title: Learning Model Predictive Controllers with Real-Time Attention for Real-World
  Navigation
section: Poster
openreview: 7Nwds2LjN1s
abstract: 'Despite decades of research, existing navigation systems still face real-world
  challenges when deployed in the wild, e.g., in cluttered home environments or in
  human-occupied public spaces. To address this, we present a new class of implicit
  control policies combining the benefits of imitation learning with the robust handling
  of system constraints from Model Predictive Control (MPC). Our approach, called
  Performer-MPC, uses a learned cost function parameterized by vision context embeddings
  provided by Performersâ€”a low-rank implicit-attention Transformer. We jointly train
  the cost function and construct the controller relying on it, effectively solving
  end-to-end the corresponding bi-level optimization problem. We show that the resulting
  policy improves standard MPC performance by leveraging a few expert demonstrations
  of the desired navigation behavior in different challenging real-world scenarios.
  Compared with a standard MPC policy, Performer-MPC achieves >40% better goal reached
  in cluttered environments and >65% better on social metrics when navigating around
  humans. '
