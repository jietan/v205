title: Is Anyone There? Learning a Planner Contingent on Perceptual Uncertainty
section: Poster
openreview: 2CSj965d9O4
abstract: Robots in complex multi-agent environments should reason about the intentions
  of observed and currently unobserved agents. In this paper, we present a new learning-based
  method for prediction and planning in complex multi-agent environments where the
  states of the other agents are partially-observed. Our approach, Active Visual Planning
  (AVP), uses high-dimensional observations to learn a flow-based generative model
  of multi-agent joint trajectories, including unobserved agents that may be revealed
  in the near future, depending on the robotâ€™s actions. Our predictive model is implemented
  using deep neural networks that map raw observations to future detection and pose
  trajectories and is learned entirely offline using a dataset of recorded observations
  (not ground-truth states). Once learned, our predictive model can be used for contingency
  planning over the potential existence, intentions, and positions of unobserved agents.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of AVP on a set of autonomous driving environments
  inspired by real-world scenarios that require reasoning about the existence of other
  unobserved agents for safe and efficient driving. In these environments, AVP achieves
  optimal closed-loop performance, while methods that do not reason about potential
  unobserved agents exhibit either overconfident or underconfident behavior.
