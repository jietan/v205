title: 'TrackletMapper: Ground Surface Segmentation and Mapping from Traffic Participant
  Trajectories'
section: Poster
openreview: qr0wqg8NqkL
abstract: Robustly classifying ground infrastructure such as roads and street crossings
  is an essential task for mobile robots operating alongside pedestrians. While many
  semantic segmentation datasets are available for autonomous vehicles, models trained
  on such datasets exhibit a large domain gap when deployed on robots operating in
  pedestrian spaces. Manually annotating images recorded from pedestrian viewpoints
  is both expensive and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, we propose \textit{TrackletMapper},
  a framework for annotating ground surface types such as sidewalks, roads, and street
  crossings from object tracklets without requiring human-annotated data. To this
  end, we project the robot ego-trajectory and the paths of other traffic participants
  into the ego-view camera images, creating sparse semantic annotations for multiple
  types of ground surfaces from which a ground segmentation model can be trained.
  We further show that the model can be self-distilled for additional performance
  benefits by aggregating a ground surface map and projecting it into the camera images,
  creating a denser set of training annotations compared to the sparse tracklet annotations.
  We qualitatively and quantitatively attest our findings on a novel large-scale dataset
  for mobile robots operating in pedestrian areas. Code and dataset will be made available
  upon acceptance of the manuscript.
