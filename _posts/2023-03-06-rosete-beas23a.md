title: Latent Plans for Task-Agnostic Offline Reinforcement Learning
section: Poster
openreview: ViYLaruFwN3
abstract: Everyday tasks of long-horizon and comprising a sequence of multiple implicit
  subtasks still impose a major challenge in offline robot control. While a number
  of prior methods aimed to address this setting with variants of imitation and offline
  reinforcement learning, the learned behavior is typically narrow and often struggles
  to reach configurable long-horizon goals. As both paradigms have complementary strengths
  and weaknesses, we propose a novel hierarchical approach that combines the strengths
  of both methods to learn task-agnostic long-horizon policies from high-dimensional
  camera observations. Concretely, we combine a low-level policy that learns latent
  skills via imitation learning and a high-level policy learned from offline reinforcement
  learning for skill-chaining the latent behavior priors. Experiments in various simulated
  and real robot control tasks show that our formulation enables producing previously
  unseen combinations of skills to reach temporally extended goals by “stitching”
  together latent skills through goal chaining with an order-of-magnitude improvement
  in performance upon state-of-the-art baselines. We even learn one multi-task visuomotor
  policy for 25 distinct manipulation tasks in the real world which outperforms both
  imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning techniques.
