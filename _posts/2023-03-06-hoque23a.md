title: 'Fleet-DAgger: Interactive Robot Fleet Learning with Scalable Human Supervision'
section: Oral
openreview: MoSC0pziRd
abstract: Commercial and industrial deployments of robot fleets at Amazon, Nimble,
  Plus One, Waymo, and Zoox query remote human teleoperators when robots are at risk
  or unable to make task progress. With continual learning, interventions from the
  remote pool of humans can also be used to improve the robot fleet control policy
  over time. A central question is how to effectively allocate limited human attention.
  Prior work addresses this in the single-robot, single-human setting; we formalize
  the Interactive Fleet Learning (IFL) setting, in which multiple robots interactively
  query and learn from multiple human supervisors. We propose Return on Human Effort
  (ROHE) as a new metric and Fleet-DAgger, a family of IFL algorithms. We present
  an open-source IFL benchmark suite of GPU-accelerated Isaac Gym environments for
  standardized evaluation and development of IFL algorithms. We compare a novel Fleet-DAgger
  algorithm to 4 baselines with 100 robots in simulation. We also perform a physical
  block-pushing experiment with 4 ABB YuMi robot arms and 2 remote humans. Experiments
  suggest that the allocation of humans to robots significantly affects the performance
  of the fleet, and that the novel Fleet-DAgger algorithm can achieve up to 8.8x higher
  ROHE than baselines. See https://tinyurl.com/fleet-dagger for supplemental material.
