title: 'LEADER: Learning Attention over Driving Behaviors for Planning under Uncertainty'
section: Oral
openreview: DE8rdNuGj_7
abstract: Uncertainty in human behaviors poses a significant challenge to autonomous
  driving in crowded urban environments. The partially observable Markov decision
  process (POMDP) offers a principled general framework for decision making under
  uncertainty and achieves real-time performance for complex tasks by leveraging Monte
  Carlo sampling. However, sampling may miss rare, but critical events, leading to
  potential safety concerns. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new algorithm,
  LEarning Attention over Driving bEhavioRs (LEADER), which learns to attend to critical
  human behaviors during planning. LEADER learns a neural network generator to provide
  attention over human behaviors; it integrates the attention into a belief-space
  planner through importance sampling, which biases planning towards critical events.
  To train the attention generator, we form a minimax game between the generator and
  the planner. By solving this minimax game, LEADER learns to perform risk-aware planning
  without explicit human effort on data labeling.
