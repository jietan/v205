title: Rethinking Optimization with Differentiable Simulation from a Global Perspective
section: Oral
openreview: Y_YUEEQMjQK
abstract: Differentiable simulation is a promising toolkit for fast gradient-based
  policy optimization and system identification. However, existing approaches to differentiable
  simulation have largely tackled scenarios where obtaining smooth gradients has been
  relatively easy, such as systems with mostly smooth dynamics. In this work, we study
  the challenges that differentiable simulation presents when it is not feasible to
  expect that a single descent reaches a global optimum, which is often a problem
  in contact-rich scenarios. We analyze the optimization landscapes of diverse scenarios
  that contain both rigid bodies and deformable objects. In dynamic environments with
  highly deformable objects and fluids, differentiable simulators produce rugged landscapes
  with nonetheless useful gradients in some parts of the space. We propose a method
  that combines Bayesian optimization with semi-local ’leaps’ to obtain a global search
  method that can use gradients effectively, while also maintaining robust performance
  in regions with noisy gradients. We show that our approach outperforms several gradient-based
  and gradient-free baselines on an extensive set of experiments in simulation, and
  also validate the method using experiments with a real robot and deformables.
