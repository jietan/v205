title: Graph Inverse Reinforcement Learning from Diverse Videos
section: Oral
openreview: awciQcCEGJs
abstract: Research on Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) from third-person videos
  has shown encouraging results on removing the need for manual reward design for
  robotic tasks. However, most prior works are still limited by training from a relatively
  restricted domain of videos. In this paper, we argue that the true potential of
  third-person IRL lies in increasing the diversity of videos for better scaling.
  To learn a reward function from diverse videos, we propose to perform graph abstraction
  on the videos followed by temporal matching in the graph space to measure the task
  progress. Our insight is that a task can be described by entity interactions that
  form a graph, and this graph abstraction can help remove irrelevant information
  such as textures, resulting in more robust reward functions. We evaluate our approach,
  GraphIRL, on cross-embodiment learning in X-MAGICAL and learning from human demonstrations
  for real-robot manipulation. We show significant improvements in robustness to diverse
  video demonstrations over previous approaches, and even achieve better results than
  manual reward design on a real robot pushing task. Videos are available at https://sateeshkumar21.github.io/GraphIRL/.
