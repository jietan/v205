title: Synthesizing Adversarial Visual Scenarios for Model-Based Robotic Control
section: Poster
openreview: WJbw_C-pCox
abstract: Today’s robots often interface data-driven perception and planning models
  with classical model-predictive controllers (MPC). Often, such learned perception/planning
  models produce erroneous waypoint predictions on out-of-distribution (OoD) or even
  adversarial visual inputs, which increase control cost. However, today’s methods
  to train robust perception models are largely task-agnostic – they augment a dataset
  using random image transformations or adversarial examples targeted at the vision
  model in isolation. As such, they often introduce pixel perturbations that are ultimately
  benign for control. In contrast to prior work that synthesizes adversarial examples
  for single-step vision tasks, our key contribution is to synthesize adversarial
  scenarios tailored to multi-step, model-based control. To do so, we use differentiable
  MPC methods to calculate the sensitivity of a model-based controller to errors in
  state estimation. We show that re-training vision models on these adversarial datasets
  improves control performance on OoD test scenarios by up to 36.2% compared to standard
  task-agnostic data augmentation. We demonstrate our method on examples of robotic
  navigation, manipulation in RoboSuite, and control of an autonomous air vehicle.
