title: 'CausalAF: Causal Autoregressive Flow for Safety-Critical Driving Scenario
  Generation'
section: Poster
openreview: wyCdmAJJY1F
abstract: Generating safety-critical scenarios, which are crucial yet difficult to
  collect, provides an effective way to evaluate the robustness of autonomous driving
  systems. However, the diversity of scenarios and efficiency of generation methods
  are heavily restricted by the rareness and structure of safety-critical scenarios.
  Therefore, existing generative models that only estimate distributions from observational
  data are not satisfying to solve this problem. In this paper, we integrate causality
  as a prior into the scenario generation and propose a flow-based generative framework,
  Causal Autoregressive Flow (CausalAF). CausalAF encourages the generative model
  to uncover and follow the causal relationship among generated objects via novel
  causal masking operations instead of searching the sample only from observational
  data. By learning the cause-and-effect mechanism of how the generated scenario causes
  risk situations rather than just learning correlations from data, CausalAF significantly
  improves learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous traffic
  scenarios illustrate that CausalAF requires much fewer optimization resources to
  effectively generate safety-critical scenarios. We also show that using generated
  scenarios as additional training samples empirically improves the robustness of
  autonomous driving algorithms.
