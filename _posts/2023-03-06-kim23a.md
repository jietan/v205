title: Topological Semantic Graph Memory for Image-Goal Navigation
section: Oral
openreview: xjTUxBfIzE
abstract: A novel framework is proposed to incrementally collect landmark-based graph
  memory and use the collected memory for image goal navigation. Given a target image
  to search, an embodied robot utilizes semantic memory to find the target in an unknown
  environment. In this paper, we present a topological semantic graph memory (TSGM),
  which consists of (1) a graph builder that takes the observed RGB-D image to construct
  a topological semantic graph, (2) a cross graph mixer module that takes the collected
  nodes to get contextual information, and (3) a memory decoder that takes the contextual
  memory as an input to find an action to the target. On the task of an image goal
  navigation, TSGM significantly outperforms competitive baselines by +5.0-9.0% on
  the success rate and +7.0-23.5% on SPL, which means that the TSGM finds efficient
  paths. Additionally, we demonstrate our method on a mobile robot in real-world image
  goal scenarios.
