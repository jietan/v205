title: Reinforcement learning with Demonstrations from Mismatched Task under Sparse
  Reward
section: Poster
openreview: NanNxv92Uih
abstract: Reinforcement learning often suffer from the sparse reward issue in real-world
  robotics problems. Learning from demonstration (LfD) is an effective way to eliminate
  this problem, which leverages collected expert data to aid online learning. Prior
  works often assume that the learning agent and the expert aim to accomplish the
  same task, which requires collecting new data for every new task. In this paper,
  we consider the case where the target task is mismatched from but similar with that
  of the expert. Such setting can be challenging and we found existing LfD methods
  may encounter a phenomenon called reward signal backward propagation blockages so
  that the agent cannot be effectively guided by the demonstrations from mismatched
  task. We propose conservative reward shaping from demonstration (CRSfD), which shapes
  the sparse rewards using estimated expert value function. To accelerate learning
  processes, CRSfD guides the agent to conservatively explore around demonstrations.
  Experimental results of robot manipulation tasks show that our approach outperforms
  baseline LfD methods when transferring demonstrations collected in a single task
  to other different but similar tasks.
