title: Learning Semantics-Aware Locomotion Skills from Human Demonstration
section: Poster
openreview: JtK7F6D8t-3
abstract: The semantics of the environment, such as the terrain type and property,
  reveals important information for legged robots to adjust their behaviors. In this
  work, we present a framework that learns semantics-aware locomotion skills from
  perception for quadrupedal robots, such that the robot can traverse through complex
  offroad terrains with appropriate speeds and gaits using perception information.
  Due to the lack of high-fidelity outdoor simulation, our framework needs to be trained
  directly in the real world, which brings unique challenges in data efficiency and
  safety. To ensure sample efficiency, we pre-train the perception model with an off-road
  driving dataset. To avoid the risks of real-world policy exploration, we leverage
  human demonstration to train a speed policy that selects a desired forward speed
  from camera image. For maximum traversability, we pair the speed policy with a gait
  selector, which selects a robust locomotion gait for each forward speed. Using only
  40 minutes of human demonstration data, our framework learns to adjust the speed
  and gait of the robot based on perceived terrain semantics, and enables the robot
  to walk over 6km without failure at close-to-optimal speed
