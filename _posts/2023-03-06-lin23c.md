title: 'MIRA: Mental Imagery for Robotic Affordances'
section: Poster
openreview: AmPeAFzU3a4
abstract: Humans form mental images of 3D scenes to support counterfactual imagination,
  planning, and motor control. Our abilities to predict the appearance and affordance
  of the scene from previously unobserved viewpoints aid us in performing manipulation
  tasks (e.g., 6-DoF kitting) with a level of ease that is currently out of reach
  for existing robot learning frameworks. In this work, we aim to build artificial
  systems that can analogously plan actions on top of imagined images. To this end,
  we introduce Mental Imagery for Robotic Affordances (MIRA), an action reasoning
  framework that optimizes actions with novel-view synthesis and affordance prediction
  in the loop. Given a set of 2D RGB images, MIRA builds a consistent 3D scene representation,
  through which we synthesize novel orthographic views amenable to pixel-wise affordances
  prediction for action optimization. We illustrate how this optimization process
  enables us to generalize to unseen out-of-plane rotations for 6-DoF robotic manipulation
  tasks given a limited number of demonstrations, paving the way toward machines that
  autonomously learn to understand the world around them for planning actions.
