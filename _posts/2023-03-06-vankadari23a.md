title: 'When the Sun Goes Down: Repairing Photometric Losses for All-Day Depth Estimation'
section: Poster
openreview: 7RyzGWLk79H
abstract: Self-supervised deep learning methods for joint depth and ego-motion estimation
  can yield accurate trajectories without needing ground-truth training data. However,
  as they typically use photometric losses, their performance can degrade significantly
  when the assumptions these losses make (e.g. temporal illumination consistency,
  a static scene, and the absence of noise and occlusions) are violated. This limits
  their use for e.g. nighttime sequences, which tend to contain many point light sources
  (including on dynamic objects) and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in darker image
  regions. In this paper, we show how to use a combination of three techniques to
  allow the existing photometric losses to work for both day and nighttime images.
  First, we introduce a per-pixel neural intensity transformation to compensate for
  the light changes that occur between successive frames. Second, we predict a per-pixel
  residual flow map that we use to correct the reprojection correspondences induced
  by the estimated ego-motion and depth from the networks. And third, we denoise the
  training images to improve the robustness and accuracy of our approach. These changes
  allow us to train a single model for both day and nighttime images without needing
  separate encoders or extra feature networks like existing methods. We perform extensive
  experiments and ablation studies on the challenging Oxford RobotCar dataset to demonstrate
  the efficacy of our approach for both day and nighttime sequences.
