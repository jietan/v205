  Demonstration'

abstract: Learning dexterous manipulation policies for multi-fingered robots has been
  a long-standing challenge in robotics. Existing methods either limit themselves
  to highly constrained problems and smaller models to achieve extreme sample efficiency
  or sacrifice sample efficiency to gain capacity to solve more complex tasks with
  deep neural networks. In this work, we develop a structured approach to sample-efficient
  learning of dexterous manipulation skills from demonstrations by leveraging recent
  advances in robot motion generation and control. Specifically, our policy structure
  is induced by Geometric Fabrics - a recent framework that generalizes classical
  mechanical systems to allow for flexible design of expressive robot motions. To
  avoid the cumbersome manual design required by existing motion generators, we introduce
  Neural Geometric Fabric (NGF) - a framework that learns Geometric Fabric-based policies
  from data. NGF policies are provably stable and capable of encoding speed-invariant
  geometries of complex motions in multiple task spaces simultaneously. We demonstrate
  that NGFs can learn to perform a variety of dexterous manipulation tasks on a 23-DoF
  hand-arm physical robotic platform purely from demonstrations. Results from comprehensive
  comparative and ablative experiments show that NGFâ€™s structure and action spaces
  help learn acceleration-based policies that consistently outperform state-of-the-art
  baselines like Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs), and other commonly used networks,
  such as feed-forward and recurrent neural networks. More importantly, we demonstrate
  that NGFs do not rely on often-used and expertly-designed operational-space controllers,
  promoting an advancement towards efficiently learning safe, stable, and high-dimensional
  controllers.
