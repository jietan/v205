title: Few-Shot Preference Learning for Human-in-the-Loop RL
section: Poster
openreview: IKC5TfXLuW0
abstract: 'While reinforcement learning (RL) has become a more popular approach for
  robotics, designing sufficiently informative reward functions for complex tasks
  has proven to be extremely difficult due their inability to capture human intent
  and policy exploitation. Preference based RL algorithms seek to overcome these challenges
  by directly learning reward functions from human feedback. Unfortunately, prior
  work either requires an unreasonable number of queries implausible for any human
  to answer or overly restricts the class of reward functions to guarantee the elicitation
  of the most informative queries, resulting in models that are insufficiently expressive
  for realistic robotics tasks. Contrary to most works that focus on query selection
  to \emph{minimize} the amount of data required for learning reward functions, we
  take an opposite approach: \emph{expanding} the pool of available data by viewing
  human-in-the-loop RL through the more flexible lens of multi-task learning. Motivated
  by the success of meta-learning, we pre-train preference models on prior task data
  and quickly adapt them for new tasks using only a handful of queries. Empirically,
  we reduce the amount of online feedback needed to train manipulation policies in
  Meta-World by 20$\times$, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a real
  Franka Panda Robot. Moreover, this reduction in query-complexity allows us to train
  robot policies from actual human users. Videos of our results can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/few-shot-preference-rl/home.'
