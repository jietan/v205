title: 'CoBEVT: Cooperative Bird’s Eye View Semantic Segmentation with Sparse Transformers'
section: Poster
openreview: PAFEQQtDf8s
abstract: Bird’s eye view (BEV) semantic segmentation plays a crucial role in spatial
  sensing for autonomous driving. Although recent literature has made significant
  progress on BEV map understanding, they are all based on single-agent camera-based
  systems. These solutions sometimes have difficulty handling occlusions or detecting
  distant objects in complex traffic scenes. Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication
  technologies have enabled autonomous vehicles to share sensing information, dramatically
  improving the perception performance and range compared to single-agent systems.
  In this paper, we propose CoBEVT, the first generic multi-agent multi-camera perception
  framework that can cooperatively generate BEV map predictions. To efficiently fuse
  camera features from multi-view and multi-agent data in an underlying Transformer
  architecture, we design a fused axial attention module (FAX), which captures sparsely
  local and global spatial interactions across views and agents. The extensive experiments
  on the V2V perception dataset, OPV2V, demonstrate that CoBEVT achieves state-of-the-art
  performance for cooperative BEV semantic segmentation. Moreover, CoBEVT is shown
  to be generalizable to other tasks, including 1) BEV segmentation with single-agent
  multi-camera and 2) 3D object detection with multi-agent LiDAR systems, achieving
  state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed. The code is available
