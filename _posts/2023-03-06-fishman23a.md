title: Motion Policy Networks
section: Poster
openreview: aQnn9cIVTRJ
abstract: Collision-free motion generation in unknown environments is a core building
  block for robot manipulation. Generating such motions is challenging due to multiple
  objectives; not only should the solutions be optimal, the motion generator itself
  must be fast enough for real-time performance and reliable enough for practical
  deployment. A wide variety of methods have been proposed ranging from local controllers
  to global planners, often being combined to offset their shortcomings. We present
  an end-to-end neural model called Motion Policy Networks (M$\pi$Nets) to generate
  collision-free, smooth motion from just a single depth camera observation. M$\pi$Nets
  are trained on over 3 million motion planning problems in more than 500,000 environments.
  Our experiments show that M$\pi$Nets are significantly faster than global planners
  while exhibiting the reactivity needed to deal with dynamic scenes. They are 46%
  better than prior neural planners and more robust than local control policies. Despite
  being only trained in simulation, M$\pi$Nets transfer well to the real robot with
  noisy partial point clouds. Videos and code are available at https://mpinets.github.io
