title: Online Dynamics Learning for Predictive Control with an Application to Aerial
  Robots
section: Poster
openreview: 8-8e18idYLD
abstract: In this work, we consider the task of improving the accuracy of dynamic
  models for model predictive control (MPC) in an online setting. Although prediction
  models can be learned and applied to model-based controllers, these models are often
  learned offline. In this offline setting, training data is first collected and a
  prediction model is learned through an elaborated training procedure. However, since
  the model is learned offline, it does not adapt to disturbances or model errors
  observed during deployment. To improve the adaptiveness of the model and the controller,
  we propose an online dynamics learning framework that continually improves the accuracy
  of the dynamic model during deployment. We adopt knowledge-based neural ordinary
  differential equations (KNODE) as the dynamic models, and use techniques inspired
  by transfer learning to continually improve the model accuracy. We demonstrate the
  efficacy of our framework with a quadrotor, and verify the framework in both simulations
  and physical experiments. Results show that our approach can account for disturbances
  that are possibly time-varying, while maintaining good trajectory tracking performance.
