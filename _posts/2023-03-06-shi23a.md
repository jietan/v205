title: Skill-based Model-based Reinforcement Learning
section: Poster
openreview: iVxy2eO601U
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) is a sample-efficient way of learning
  complex behaviors by leveraging a learned single-step dynamics model to plan actions
  in imagination. However, planning every action for long-horizon tasks is not practical,
  akin to a human planning out every muscle movement. Instead, humans efficiently
  plan with high-level skills to solve complex tasks. From this intuition, we propose
  a Skill-based Model-based RL framework (SkiMo) that enables planning in the skill
  space using a skill dynamics model, which directly predicts the skill outcomes,
  rather than predicting all small details in the intermediate states, step by step.
  For accurate and efficient long-term planning, we jointly learn the skill dynamics
  model and a skill repertoire from prior experience. We then harness the learned
  skill dynamics model to accurately simulate and plan over long horizons in the skill
  space, which enables efficient downstream learning of long-horizon, sparse reward
  tasks. Experimental results in navigation and manipulation domains show that SkiMo
  extends the temporal horizon of model-based approaches and improves the sample efficiency
  for both model-based RL and skill-based RL. Code and videos are available at https://clvrai.com/skimo
