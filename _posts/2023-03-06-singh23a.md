title: Particle-Based Score Estimation for State Space Model Learning in Autonomous
  Driving
section: Poster
openreview: 7JVNhaMbZUu
abstract: Multi-object state estimation is a fundamental problem for robotic applications
  where a robot must interact with other moving objects. Typically, other objects’
  relevant state features are not directly observable, and must instead be inferred
  from observations. Particle filtering can perform such inference given approximate
  transition and observation models. However, these models are often unknown a priori,
  yielding a difficult parameter estimation problem since observations jointly carry
  transition and observation noise. In this work, we consider learning maximum-likelihood
  parameters using particle methods. Recent methods addressing this problem typically
  differentiate through time in a particle filter, which requires workarounds to the
  non-differentiable resampling step, that yield biased or high variance gradient
  estimates. By contrast, we exploit Fisher’s identity to obtain a particle-based
  approximation of the score function (the gradient of the log likelihood) that yields
  a low variance estimate while only requiring stepwise differentiation through the
  transition and observation models. We apply our method to real data collected from
  autonomous vehicles (AVs) and show that it learns better models than existing techniques
  and is more stable in training, yielding an effective smoother for tracking the
  trajectories of vehicles around an AV.
