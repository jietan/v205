title: Safe Robot Learning in Assistive Devices through Neural Network Repair
section: Poster
openreview: X4228W0QpvN
abstract: Assistive robotic devices are a particularly promising field of application
  for neural networks (NN) due to the need for personalization and hard-to-model human-machine
  interaction dynamics. However, NN based estimators and controllers may produce potentially
  unsafe outputs over previously unseen data points. In this paper, we introduce an
  algorithm for updating NN control policies to satisfy a given set of formal safety
  constraints, while also optimizing the original loss function.  Given a set of mixed-integer
  linear constraints, we define the NN repair problem as a Mixed Integer Quadratic
  Program (MIQP). In extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our repair
  method in generating safe policies for a lower-leg prosthesis.
