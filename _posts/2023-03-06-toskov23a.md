title: In-Hand Gravitational Pivoting Using Tactile Sensing
section: Poster
openreview: NEGjAH7p0fm
abstract: We study gravitational pivoting, a constrained version of in-hand manipulation,
  where we aim to control the rotation of an object around the grip point of a parallel
  gripper. To achieve this, instead of controlling the gripper to avoid slip, we \emph{embrace
  slip} to allow the object to rotate in-hand. We collect two real-world datasets,
  a static tracking dataset and a controller-in-the-loop dataset, both annotated with
  object angle and angular velocity labels. Both datasets contain force-based tactile
  information on ten different household objects. We train an LSTM model to predict
  the angular position and velocity of the held object from purely tactile data. We
  integrate this model with a controller that opens and closes the gripper allowing
  the object to rotate to desired relative angles. We conduct real-world experiments
  where the robot is tasked to achieve a relative target angle. We show that our approach
  outperforms a sliding-window based MLP in a zero-shot generalization setting with
  unseen objects. Furthermore, we show a 16.6% improvement in performance when the
  LSTM model is fine-tuned on a small set of data collected with both the LSTM model
  and the controller in-the-loop. Code and videos are available at https://rhys-newbury.github.io/projects/pivoting/.
