abstract: 'Long horizon robot learning tasks with sparse rewards pose a significant
  challenge for current reinforcement learning algorithms. A key feature enabling
  humans to learn challenging control tasks is that they often receive expert intervention
  that enables them to understand the high-level structure of the task before mastering
  low-level control actions. We propose a framework for leveraging expert intervention
  to solve long-horizon reinforcement learning tasks. We consider \emph{option templates},
  which are specifications encoding a potential option that can be trained using reinforcement
  learning. We formulate expert intervention as allowing the agent to execute option
  templates  before learning an implementation. This enables them to use an option,
  before committing costly resources to learning it. We evaluate our approach on three
  challenging reinforcement learning problems, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art
  approaches by two orders of magnitude. Videos of trained agents and our code can
