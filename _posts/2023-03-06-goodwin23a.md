title: 'You Only Look at One: Category-Level Object Representations for Pose Estimation
  From a Single Example'
section: Poster
openreview: lb7B5Rw7tjw
abstract: 'In order to meaningfully interact with the world, robot manipulators must
  be able to interpret objects they encounter. A critical aspect of this interpretation
  is pose estimation: inferring quantities that describe the position and orientation
  of an object in 3D space. Most existing approaches to pose estimation make limiting
  assumptions, often working only for specific, known object instances, or at best
  generalising to an object category using large pose-labelled datasets. In this work,
  we present a method for achieving category-level pose estimation by inspection of
  just a single object from a desired category. We show that we can subsequently perform
  accurate pose estimation for unseen objects from an inspected category, and considerably
  outperform prior work by exploiting multi-view correspondences. We demonstrate that
  our method runs in real-time, enabling a robot manipulator to rearrange previously
  unseen objects faithfully in terms of placement and orientation. Finally, we showcase
  our method in a continual learning setting, with a robot able to determine whether
  objects belong to known categories, and if not, use active perception to produce
  a one-shot category representation for subsequent pose estimation'
