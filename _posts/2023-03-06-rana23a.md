title: 'Residual Skill Policies: Learning an Adaptable Skill-based Action Space for
  Reinforcement Learning for Robotics'
section: Poster

abstract: Skill-based reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising strategy
  to leverage prior knowledge for accelerated robot learning. Skills are typically
  extracted from expert demonstrations and are embedded into a latent space from which
  they can be sampled as actions by a high-level RL agent. However, this \textit{skill
  space} is expansive, and not all skills are relevant for a given robot state, making
  exploration difficult. Furthermore, the downstream RL agent is limited to learning
  structurally similar tasks to those used to construct the skill space. We firstly
  propose accelerating exploration in the skill space using state-conditioned generative
  models to directly bias the high-level agent towards only \textit{sampling} skills
  relevant to a given state based on prior experience. Next, we propose a low-level
  residual policy for fine-grained \textit{skill adaptation} enabling downstream RL
  agents to adapt to unseen task variations. Finally, we validate our approach across
  four challenging manipulation tasks that differ from those used to build the skill
  space, demonstrating our ability to learn across task variations while significantly
  accelerating exploration, outperforming prior works.
