  Approach'
section: Poster
openreview: iM932PeUi_7
abstract: Fleets of networked autonomous vehicles (AVs) collect terabytes of sensory
  data, which is often transmitted to central servers (the “cloud”) for training machine
  learning (ML) models. Ideally, these fleets should upload all their data, especially
  from rare operating contexts, in order to train robust ML models. However, this
  is infeasible due to prohibitive network bandwidth and data labeling costs. Instead,
  we propose a cooperative data sampling strategy where geo-distributed AVs collaborate
  to collect a diverse ML training dataset in the cloud. Since the AVs have a shared
  objective but minimal information about each other’s local data distribution and
  perception model, we can naturally cast cooperative data collection as an $N$-player
  mathematical game. We show that our cooperative sampling strategy uses minimal information
  to converge to a centralized oracle policy with complete information about all AVs.
  Moreover, we theoretically characterize the performance benefits of our game-theoretic
  strategy compared to greedy sampling. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that
  our method outperforms standard benchmarks by up to $21.9%$ on 4 perception datasets,
  including for autonomous driving in adverse weather conditions. Crucially, our experimental
  results on real-world datasets closely align with our theoretical guarantees.
