title: Embedding Synthetic Off-Policy Experience for Autonomous Driving via Zero-Shot
  Curricula
section: Oral
openreview: cF1dxVGxic-
abstract: ML-based motion planning is a promising approach to produce agents that
  exhibit complex behaviors, and automatically adapt to novel environments. In the
  context of autonomous driving, it is common to treat all available training data
  equally. However, this approach produces agents that do not perform robustly in
  safety-critical settings, an issue that cannot be addressed by simply adding more
  data to the training set – we show that an agent trained using only a 10% subset
  of the data performs just as well as an agent trained on the entire dataset. We
  present a method to predict the inherent difficulty of a driving situation given
  data collected from a fleet of autonomous vehicles deployed on public roads. We
  then demonstrate that this difficulty score can be used in a zero-shot transfer
  to generate curricula for an imitation-learning based planning agent. Compared to
  training on the entire unbiased training dataset, we show that prioritizing difficult
  driving scenarios both reduces collisions by 15% and increases route adherence by
  14% in closed-loop evaluation, all while using only 10% of the training data.
