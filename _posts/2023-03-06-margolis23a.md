title: 'Walk These Ways: Tuning Robot Control for Generalization with Multiplicity
  of Behavior'
section: Oral
openreview: 52c5e73SlS2
abstract: 'Learned locomotion policies can rapidly adapt to diverse environments similar
  to those experienced during training but lack a mechanism for fast tuning when they
  fail in an out-of-distribution test environment. This necessitates a slow and iterative
  cycle of reward and environment redesign to achieve good performance on a new task.
  As an alternative, we propose learning a single policy that encodes a structured
  family of locomotion strategies that solve training tasks in different ways, resulting
  in Multiplicity of Behavior (MoB). Different strategies generalize differently and
  can be chosen in real-time for new tasks or environments, bypassing the need for
  time-consuming retraining. We release a fast, robust open-source MoB locomotion
  controller, Walk These Ways, that can execute diverse gaits with variable footswing,
  posture, and speed, unlocking diverse downstream tasks: crouching, hopping, high-speed
  running, stair traversal, bracing against shoves, rhythmic dance, and more. Video
