title: Learning Road Scene-level Representations via Semantic Region Prediction
section: Poster
openreview: DLkubm-dq-y
abstract: 'In this work, we tackle two vital tasks in automated driving systems, i.e.,
  driver intent prediction and risk object identification from egocentric images.
  Mainly, we investigate the question: what would be good road scene-level representations
  for these two tasks? We contend that a scene-level representation must capture higher-level
  semantic and geometric representations of traffic scenes around ego-vehicle while
  performing actions to their destinations. To this end, we introduce the representation
  of semantic regions, which are areas where ego-vehicles visit while taking an afforded
  action (e.g., left-turn at 4-way intersections). We propose to learn scene-level
  representations via a novel semantic region prediction task and an automatic semantic
  region labeling algorithm. Extensive evaluations are conducted on the HDD and nuScenes
  datasets, and the learned representations lead to state-of-the-art performance for
  driver intention prediction and risk object identification. '
