abstract: " Trajectory prediction is one of the basic tasks in the autonomous driving
  field, which aims to predict the future position of other agents around the ego
  vehicle so that a safe yet efficient driving plan could be generated in the downstream
  module. Recently, deep learning based methods dominate the field. State-of-the-art
  (SOTA) methods usually follow an encoder-decoder paradigm. Specifically, the encoder
  is responsible for extracting information from agents’ history states and HD-Map
  and providing a representation vector for each agent. Taking these vectors as input,
  the decoder predicts multi-step future positions for each agent, which is usually
  accomplished by a single multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to directly output a Tx2 tensor.
  Though models with adoptation of MLP decoder have dominated the leaderboard of multiple
  datasets, ‘the elephant in the room is that the temporal correlation among future
  time-steps is ignored since there is no direct relation among output neurons of
  a MLP. In this work, we examine this design choice and investigate several ways
  to apply the temporal inductive bias into the generation of future trajectories
  on top of a SOTA encoder. We find that simply using autoregressive RNN to generate
  future positions would lead to significant performance drop even with techniques
  such as history highway and teacher forcing. Instead, taking scratch trajectories
  generated by MLP as input, an additional refinement module based on structures with
  temporal prior such as RNN or 1D-CNN could remarkably boost the accuracy. Furthermore,
  we examine several objective functions to  emphasize the temporal priors. By the
  combination of aforementioned techniques to introduce the temporal prior, we improve
  the top-ranked method’s performance by a large margin and achieve SOTA result on
  the Waymo Open Motion Challenge."
