title: Volumetric-based Contact Point Detection for 7-DoF Grasping
section: Poster
openreview: SrSCqW4dq9
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel grasp pipeline based on contact point
  detection on the truncated signed distance function (TSDF) volume to achieve closed-loop
  7-degree-of-freedom (7-DoF) grasping on cluttered environments. The key aspects
  of our method are that 1) the proposed pipeline exploits the TSDF volume in terms
  of multi-view fusion, contact-point sampling and evaluation, and collision checking,
  which provides reliable and collision-free 7-DoF gripper poses with real-time performance;
  2) the contact-based pose representation effectively eliminates the ambiguity introduced
  by the normal-based methods, which provides a more precise and flexible solution.
  Extensive simulated and real-robot experiments demonstrate that the proposed pipeline
  can select more antipodal and stable grasp poses and outperforms normal-based baselines
  in terms of the grasp success rate in both simulated and physical scenarios. Code
