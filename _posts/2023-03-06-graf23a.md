title: Learning Dense Visual Descriptors using Image Augmentations for Robot Manipulation
  Tasks
section: Poster
openreview: b1zMsZuzd2e
abstract: We propose a self-supervised training approach for learning view-invariant
  dense visual descriptors using image augmentations. Unlike existing works, which
  often require complex datasets, such as registered RGBD sequences, we train on an
  unordered set of RGB images. This allows for learning from a single camera view,
  e.g., in an existing robotic cell with a fix-mounted camera. We create synthetic
  views and dense pixel correspondences using data augmentations. We find our descriptors
  are competitive to the existing methods, despite the simpler data recording and
  setup requirements. We show that training on synthetic correspondences provides
  descriptor consistency across a broad range of camera views. We compare against
  training with geometric correspondence from multiple views and provide ablation
  studies. We also show a robotic bin-picking experiment using descriptors learned
  from a fix-mounted camera for defining grasp preferences.
