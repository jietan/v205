title: Fast Lifelong Adaptive Inverse Reinforcement Learning from Demonstrations
section: Poster
openreview: oLLOSt3zV4
abstract: 'Learning from Demonstration (LfD) approaches empower end-users to teach
  robots novel tasks via demonstrations of the desired behaviors, democratizing access
  to robotics. However, current LfD frameworks are not capable of fast adaptation
  to heterogeneous human demonstrations nor the large-scale deployment in ubiquitous
  robotics applications. In this paper, we propose a novel LfD framework, Fast Lifelong
  Adaptive Inverse Reinforcement learning (FLAIR). Our approach (1) leverages learned
  strategies to construct policy mixtures for fast adaptation to new demonstrations,
  allowing for quick end-user personalization, (2) distills common knowledge across
  demonstrations, achieving accurate task inference; and (3) expands its model only
  when needed in lifelong deployments, maintaining a concise set of prototypical strategies
  that can approximate all behaviors via policy mixtures. We empirically validate
  that FLAIR achieves adaptability (i.e., the robot adapts to heterogeneous, user-specific
  task preferences), efficiency (i.e., the robot achieves sample-efficient adaptation),
  and scalability (i.e., the model grows sublinearly with the number of demonstrations
  while maintaining high performance). FLAIR surpasses benchmarks across three control
  tasks with an average 57% improvement in policy returns and an average 78% fewer
  episodes required for demonstration modeling using policy mixtures. Finally, we
  demonstrate the success of FLAIR in a table tennis task and find users rate FLAIR
  as having higher task ($p<.05$) and personalization ($p<.05$) performance. '
