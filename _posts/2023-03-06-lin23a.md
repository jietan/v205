title: SE(3)-Equivariant Point Cloud-Based Place Recognition
section: Poster
openreview: gUtbYFHluAg
abstract: 'This paper reports on a new 3D point cloud-based place recognition framework
  that uses SE(3)-equivariant networks to learn SE(3)-invariant global descriptors.
  We discover that, unlike existing methods, learned SE(3)-invariant global descriptors
  are more robust to matching inaccuracy and failure in severe rotation and translation
  configurations. Mobile robots undergo arbitrary rotational and translational movements.
  The SE(3)-invariant property ensures that the learned descriptors are robust to
  the rotation and translation changes in the robot pose and can represent the intrinsic
  geometric information of the scene. Furthermore, we have discovered that the attention
  module aids in the enhancement of performance while allowing significant downsampling.
  We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework on real-world data sets. The
  experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art
  baselines in various metrics, leading to a reliable point cloud-based place recognition
  network. We have open-sourced our code at: https://github.com/UMich-CURLY/se3_equivariant_place_recognition.'
