title: Learning Multi-Objective Curricula for Robotic Policy Learning
section: Poster
openreview: ZL2keFk7WXJ
abstract: Various automatic curriculum learning (ACL) methods have been proposed to
  improve the sample efficiency and final performance of robotsâ€™ policies learning.
  They are designed to control how a robotic agent collects data, which is inspired
  by how humans gradually adapt their learning processes to their capabilities. In
  this paper, we propose a unified automatic curriculum learning framework to create
  multi-objective but coherent curricula that are generated by a set of parametric
  curriculum modules. Each curriculum module is instantiated as a neural network and
  is responsible for generating a particular curriculum. In order to coordinate those
  potentially conflicting modules in unified parameter space, we propose a multi-task
  hyper-net learning framework that uses a single hyper-net to parameterize all those
  curriculum modules. We evaluate our method on a series of robotic manipulation tasks
  and demonstrate its superiority over other state-of-the-art ACL methods in terms
  of sample efficiency and final performance.
