title: Task-Relevant Failure Detection for Trajectory Predictors in Autonomous Vehicles
section: Poster
openreview: oPRhm0Aben_
abstract: In modern autonomy stacks, prediction modules are paramount to planning
  motions in the presence of other mobile agents. However, failures in prediction
  modules can mislead the downstream planner into making unsafe decisions. Indeed,
  the high uncertainty inherent to the task of trajectory forecasting ensures that
  such mispredictions occur frequently. Motivated by the need to improve safety of
  autonomous vehicles without compromising on their performance, we develop a probabilistic
  run-time monitor that detects when a "harmful" prediction failure occurs, i.e.,
  a task-relevant failure detector. We achieve this by propagating trajectory prediction
  errors to the planning cost to reason about their impact on the AV. Furthermore,
  our detector comes equipped with performance measures on the false-positive and
  the false-negative rate and allows for data-free calibration. In our experiments
  we compared our detector with various others and found that our detector has the
  highest area under the receiver operator characteristic curve.
