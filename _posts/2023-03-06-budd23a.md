title: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning for Single-Episode Missions in Partially Unknown
  Environments
section: Poster
openreview: KwdUWypQ5gC
abstract: We consider planning for mobile robots conducting missions in real-world
  domains where a priori unknown dynamics affect the robotâ€™s costs and transitions.
  We study single-episode missions where it is crucial that the robot appropriately
  trades off exploration and exploitation, such that the learning of the environment
  dynamics is just enough to effectively complete the mission. Thus, we propose modelling
  unknown dynamics using Gaussian processes, which provide a principled Bayesian framework
  for incorporating online observations made by the robot, and using them to predict
  the dynamics in unexplored areas. We then formulate the problem of mission planning
  in Markov decision processes under Gaussian process predictions as Bayesian model-based
  reinforcement learning. This allows us to employ solution techniques that plan more
  efficiently than previous Gaussian process planning methods are able to. We empirically
  evaluate the benefits of our formulation in an underwater autonomous vehicle navigation
  task and robot mission planning in a realistic simulation of a nuclear environment.
