title: Deep Projective Rotation Estimation through Relative Supervision
section: Poster
openreview: ZezSmJq06Ep
abstract: 'Orientation estimation is the core to a variety of vision and robotics
  tasks such as camera and object pose estimation. Deep learning has offered a way
  to develop image-based orientation estimators; however, such estimators often require
  training on a large labeled dataset, which can be time-intensive to collect. In
  this work, we explore whether self-supervised learning from unlabeled data can be
  used to alleviate this issue.  Specifically, we assume access to estimates of the
  relative orientation between neighboring poses, such that can be obtained via a
  local alignment method. While self-supervised learning has been used successfully
  for translational object keypoints, in this work, we show that naively applying
  relative supervision to the rotational group $SO(3)$ will often fail to converge
  due to the non-convexity of the rotational space. To tackle this challenge, we propose
  a new algorithm for self-supervised orientation estimation which utilizes Modified
  Rodrigues Parameters to stereographically project the closed manifold of $SO(3)$
  to the open manifold of $\mathbb{R}^{3}$, allowing the optimization to be done in
  an open Euclidean space. We empirically validate the benefits of the proposed algorithm
  for rotational averaging problem in two settings: (1) direct optimization on rotation
  parameters, and (2) optimization of parameters of a convolutional neural network
  that predicts object orientations from images. In both settings, we demonstrate
  that our proposed algorithm is able to converge to a consistent relative orientation
  frame much faster than algorithms that purely operate in the $SO(3)$ space. Additional
