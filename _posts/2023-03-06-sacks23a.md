title: Learning Sampling Distributions for Model Predictive Control
section: Poster
openreview: 8ktEdb5NHEh
abstract: Sampling-based methods have become a cornerstone of contemporary approaches
  to Model Predictive Control (MPC), as they make no restrictions on the differentiability
  of the dynamics or cost function and are straightforward to parallelize. However,
  their efficacy is highly dependent on the quality of the sampling distribution itself,
  which is often assumed to be simple, like a Gaussian. This restriction can result
  in samples which are far from optimal, leading to poor performance. Recent work
  has explored improving the performance of MPC by sampling in a learned latent space
  of controls. However, these methods ultimately perform all MPC parameter updates
  and warm-starting between time steps in the control space. This requires us to rely
  on a number of heuristics for generating samples and updating the distribution and
  may lead to sub-optimal performance. Instead, we propose to carry out all operations
  in the latent space, allowing us to take full advantage of the learned distribution.
  Specifically, we frame the learning problem as bi-level optimization and show how
  to train the controller with backpropagation-through-time. By using a normalizing
  flow parameterization of the distribution, we can leverage its tractable density
  to avoid requiring differentiability of the dynamics and cost function. Finally,
  we evaluate the proposed approach on simulated robotics tasks and demonstrate its
  ability to surpass the performance of prior methods and scale better with a reduced
  number of samples.
