title: Efficient and Stable Off-policy Training via Behavior-aware Evolutionary Learning
section: Poster
openreview: 52uzsIGV32_
abstract: Applying reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world continuos
  control problems faces many challenges in terms of sample efficiency, stability
  and exploration. Off-policy RL algorithms show great sample efficiency but can be
  unstable to train and require effective exploration techniques for sparse reward
  environments. A simple yet effective approach to address these challenges is to
  train a population of policies and ensemble them in certain ways. In this work,
  a novel population based evolutionary training framework inspired by evolution strategies
  (ES) called Behavior-aware Evolutionary Learning (BEL) is proposed. The main idea
  is to train a population of behaviorally diverse policies in parallel and conduct
  selection with simple linear recombination. BEL consists of two mechanisms called
  behavior-regularized perturbation (BRP) and behavior-targeted training (BTT) to
  accomplish stable and fine control of the population behavior divergence. Experimental
  studies showed that BEL not only has superior sample efficiency and stability compared
  to existing methods, but can also produce diverse agents in sparse reward environments.
  Due to the parallel implementation, BEL also exhibits relatively good computation
  efficiency, making it a practical and competitive method to train policies for real-world
  robots.
