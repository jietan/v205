title: 'COACH: Cooperative Robot Teaching'
section: Poster
openreview: niys1Zt1blq
abstract: 'Knowledge and skills can transfer from human teachers to human students.
  However, such direct transfer is often not scalable for physical tasks, as they
  require one-to-one interaction, and human teachers are not available in sufficient
  numbers.  Machine learning enables robots to become experts and play the role of
  teachers to help in this situation.  In this work, we formalize cooperative robot
  teaching as a Markov game, consisting of four key elements: the target task, the
  student model, the teacher model, and the interactive teaching-learning process.  Under
  a moderate assumption, the Markov game reduces to a partially observable Markov
  decision process, with an efficient approximate solution. We illustrate our approach
  on two cooperative tasks, one in a simulated video game and one with a real robot.'
