title: Data-Efficient Model Learning for Control with Jacobian-Regularized Dynamic-Mode
  Decomposition
section: Poster
openreview: ED0G14V3WeH
abstract: We present a data-efficient algorithm for learning models for model-predictive
  control (MPC). Our approach, Jacobian-Regularized Dynamic-Mode Decomposition (JDMD),
  offers improved sample efficiency over traditional Koopman approaches based on Dynamic-Mode
  Decomposition (DMD) by leveraging Jacobian information from an approximate prior
  model of the system, and improved tracking performance over traditional model-based
  MPC. We demonstrate JDMDâ€™s ability to quickly learn bilinear Koopman dynamics representations
  across several realistic examples in simulation, including a perching maneuver for
  a fixed-wing aircraft with an empirically derived high-fidelity physics model. In
  all cases, we show that the models learned by JDMD provide superior tracking and
  generalization performance within a model-predictive control framework, even in
  the presence of significant model mismatch, when compared to approximate prior models
  and models learned by standard Extended DMD (EDMD).
