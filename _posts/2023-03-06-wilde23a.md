title: Do we use the Right Measure? Challenges in Evaluating Reward Learning Algorithms
section: Poster
openreview: 1vV0JRA2HY0
abstract: Reward learning is a highly active area of research in human-robot interaction
  (HRI), allowing a broad range of users to specify complex robot behaviour. Experiments
  with simulated user input play a major role in the development and evaluation of
  reward learning algorithms due to the availability of a ground truth. In this paper,
  we review measures for evaluating reward learning algorithms used in HRI, most of
  which fall into two classes. In a theoretical worst case analysis and several examples,
  we show that both classes of measures can fail to effectively indicate how good
  the learned robot behaviour is. Thus, our work contributes to the characterization
  of sim-to-real gaps of reward learning in HRI.
