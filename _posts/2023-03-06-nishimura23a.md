title: 'RAP: Risk-Aware Prediction for Robust Planning'
section: Oral
openreview: z_hPo2Fu9A3
abstract: Robust planning in interactive scenarios requires predicting the uncertain
  future to make risk-aware decisions. Unfortunately, due to long-tail safety-critical
  events, the risk is often under-estimated by finite-sampling approximations of probabilistic
  motion forecasts. This can lead to overconfident and unsafe robot behavior, even
  with robust planners. Instead of assuming full prediction coverage that robust planners
  require, we propose to make prediction itself risk-aware. We introduce a new prediction
  objective to learn a risk-biased distribution over trajectories, so that risk evaluation
  simplifies to an expected cost estimation under this biased distribution. This reduces
  sample complexity of the risk estimation during online planning, which is needed
  for safe real-time performance. Evaluation results in a didactic simulation environment
  and on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The code
  and a demo are available.
