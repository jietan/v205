title: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Visual Navigation
section: Oral
openreview: uhIfIEIiWm_
abstract: Reinforcement learning can enable robots to navigate to distant goals while
  optimizing user-specified reward functions, including preferences for following
  lanes, staying on paved paths, or avoiding freshly mowed grass. However, online
  learning from trial-and-error for real-world robots is logistically challenging,
  and methods that instead can utilize existing datasets of robotic navigation data
  could be significantly more scalable and enable broader generalization. In this
  paper, we present ReViND, the first offline RL system for robotic navigation that
  can leverage previously collected data to optimize user-specified reward functions
  in the real-world. We evaluate our system for off-road navigation without any additional
  data collection or fine-tuning, and show that it can navigate to distant goals using
  only offline training from this dataset, and exhibit behaviors that qualitatively
  differ based on the user-specified reward function.
