title: 'CC-3DT: Panoramic 3D Object Tracking via Cross-Camera Fusion'
section: Poster
openreview: nBnHXevkjZ
abstract: 'To track the 3D locations and trajectories of the other traffic participants
  at any given time, modern autonomous vehicles are equipped with multiple cameras
  that cover the vehicleâ€™s full surroundings. Yet, camera-based 3D object tracking
  methods prioritize optimizing the single-camera setup and resort to post-hoc fusion
  in a multi-camera setup. In this paper, we propose a method for panoramic 3D object
  tracking, called CC-3DT, that associates and models object trajectories both temporally
  and across views, and improves the overall tracking consistency. In particular,
  our method fuses 3D detections from multiple cameras before association, reducing
  identity switches significantly and improving motion modeling. Our experiments on
  large-scale driving datasets show that fusion before association leads to a large
  margin of improvement over post-hoc fusion. We set a new state-of-the-art with 12.6%
  improvement in average multi-object tracking accuracy (AMOTA) among all camera-based
  methods on the competitive NuScenes 3D tracking benchmark, outperforming previously
  published methods by 6.5% in AMOTA with the same 3D detector. '
