abstract: 'Constructing a diverse repertoire of manipulation skills in a scalable
  fashion remains an unsolved challenge in robotics. One way to address this challenge
  is with unstructured human play, where humans operate freely in an environment to
  reach unspecified goals. Play is a simple and cheap method for collecting diverse
  user demonstrations with broad state and goal coverage over an environment. Due
  to this diverse coverage, existing approaches for learning from play are more robust
  to online policy deviations from the offline data distribution. However, these methods
  often struggle to learn under scene variation and on challenging manipulation primitives,
  due in part to improperly associating complex behaviors to the scene changes they
  induce. Our insight is that an object-centric view of play data can help link human
  behaviors and the resulting changes in the environment, and thus improve multi-task
  policy learning. In this work, we construct a latent space to model object \textit{affordances}
  – properties of an object that define its uses – in the environment, and then learn
  a policy to achieve the desired affordances. By modeling and predicting the desired
  affordance across variable horizon tasks, our method, Predicting Latent Affordances
  Through Object-Centric Play (PLATO), outperforms existing methods on complex manipulation
  tasks in both 2D and 3D object manipulation simulation and real world environments
  for diverse types of interactions. Videos can be found on our website: https://sites.google.com/view/plato-corl22/home.'
