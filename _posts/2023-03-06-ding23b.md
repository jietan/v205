title: 'Embodied Concept Learner: Self-supervised Learning of Concepts and Mapping
  through Instruction Following'
section: Poster
openreview: yPJ9A0GWLg0
abstract: 'Humans, even at a very early age, can learn visual concepts and understand
  geometry and layout through active interaction with the environment, and generalize
  their compositions to complete tasks described by natural languages in novel scenes.
  To mimic such capability, we propose Embodied Concept Learner (ECL) in an interactive
  3D environment. Specifically, a robot agent can ground visual concepts, build semantic
  maps and plan actions to complete tasks by learning purely from human demonstrations
  and language instructions, without access to ground-truth semantic and depth supervision
  from simulations. ECL consists of: (i) an instruction parser that translates the
  natural languages into executable programs; (ii) an embodied concept learner that
  grounds visual concepts based on language descriptions; (iii) a map constructor
  that estimates depth and constructs semantic maps by leveraging the learned concepts;
  and (iv) a program executor with deterministic policies to execute each program.
  ECL has several appealing benefits thanks to its modularized design. Firstly, it
  enables the robotic agent to learn semantics and depth unsupervisedly acting like
  babies, e.g., ground concepts through active interaction and perceive depth by disparities
  when moving forward. Secondly, ECL is fully transparent and step-by-step interpretable
  in long-term planning. Thirdly, ECL could be beneficial for the embodied instruction
  following (EIF), outperforming previous works on the ALFRED benchmark when the semantic
  label is not provided. Also, the learned concept can be reused for other downstream
  tasks, such as reasoning of object states.'
