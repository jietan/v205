title: 'See, Hear, and Feel: Smart Sensory Fusion for Robotic Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: sygvGP-YLfx
abstract: 'Humans use all of their senses to accomplish different tasks in everyday
  activities. In contrast, existing work on robotic manipulation mostly relies on
  one, or occasionally two modalities, such as vision and touch. In this work, we
  systematically study how visual, auditory, and tactile perception can jointly help
  robots to solve complex manipulation tasks. We build a robot system that can see
  with a camera, hear with a contact microphone, and feel with a vision-based tactile
  sensor, with all three sensory modalities fused with a self-attention model. Results
  on two challenging tasks, dense packing and pouring, demonstrate the necessity and
  power of multisensory perception for robotic manipulation: vision displays the global
  status of the robot but can often suffer from occlusion, audio provides immediate
  feedback of key moments that are even invisible, and touch offers precise local
  geometry for decision making. Leveraging all three modalities, our robotic system
  significantly outperforms prior methods.'
