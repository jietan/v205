title: 'MidasTouch: Monte-Carlo inference over distributions across sliding touch'
section: Oral
openreview: JWROnOf4w-K
abstract: 'We present MidasTouch, a tactile perception system for online global localization
  of a vision-based touch sensor sliding on an object surface. This framework takes
  in posed tactile images over time, and outputs an evolving distribution of sensor
  pose on the objectâ€™s surface, without the need for visual priors. Our key insight
  is to estimate local surface geometry with tactile sensing, learn a compact representation
  for it, and disambiguate these signals over a long time horizon. The backbone of
  MidasTouch is a Monte-Carlo particle filter, with a measurement model based on a
  tactile code network learned from tactile simulation. This network, inspired by
  LIDAR place recognition, compactly summarizes local surface geometries. These generated
  codes are efficiently compared against a precomputed tactile codebook per-object,
  to update the pose distribution. We further release the YCB-Slide dataset of real-world
  and simulated forceful sliding interactions between a vision-based tactile sensor
  and standard YCB objects. While single-touch localization can be inherently ambiguous,
  we can quickly localize our sensor by traversing salient surface geometries. Project
