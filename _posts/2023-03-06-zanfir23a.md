abstract: Autonomous driving is an exciting new industry, posing important research
  questions. Within the perception module, 3D human pose estimation is an emerging
  technology, which can enable the autonomous vehicle to perceive and understand the
  subtle and complex behaviors of pedestrians. While hardware systems and sensors
  have dramatically improved over the decades – with cars potentially boasting complex
  LiDAR and vision systems and with a growing expansion of the available body of dedicated
  datasets for this newly available information – not much work has been done to harness
  these novel signals for the core problem of 3D human pose estimation. Our method,
  which we coin HUM3DIL (HUMan 3D from Images and LiDAR), efficiently uses of these
  complementary signals, in a semi-supervised fashion and outperforms existing methods
  with a large margin. It is a fast and compact model for onboard deployment. Specifically,
  we embed LiDAR points into pixel-aligned multi-modal features, which we pass through
  a sequence of Transformer refinement stages. Quantitative experiments on the Waymo
  Open Dataset support these claims, where we achieve state-of-the-art results on
  the task of 3D pose estimation.
