title: Learning Control Admissibility Models with Graph Neural Networks for Multi-Agent
  Navigation
section: Poster
openreview: xC-68ANJeK_
abstract: 'Deep reinforcement learning in continuous domains focuses on learning control
  policies that map states to distributions over actions that ideally concentrate
  on the optimal choices in each step. In multi-agent navigation problems, the optimal
  actions depend heavily on the agentsâ€™ density. Their interaction patterns grow exponentially
  with respect to such density, making it hard for learning-based methods to generalize.
  We propose to switch the learning objectives from predicting the optimal actions
  to predicting sets of admissible actions, which we call control admissibility models
  (CAMs), such that they can be easily composed and used for online inference for
  an arbitrary number of agents. We design CAMs using graph neural networks and develop
  training methods that optimize the CAMs in the standard model-free setting, with
  the additional benefit of eliminating the need for reward engineering typically
  required to balance collision avoidance and goal-reaching requirements. We evaluate
  the proposed approach in multi-agent navigation environments. We show that the CAM
  models can be trained in environments with only a few agents and be easily composed
  for deployment in dense environments with hundreds of agents, achieving better performance
  than state-of-the-art methods. '
