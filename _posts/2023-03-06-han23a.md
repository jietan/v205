title: Planning Paths through Occlusions in Urban Environments
section: Oral
openreview: pVSaWTgDmCu
abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for planning in unknown and occluded
  urban spaces. We specifically focus on turns and intersections where occlusions
  significantly impact navigability. Our approach uses an inpainting model to fill
  in a sparse, occluded, semantic lidar point cloud and plans dynamically feasible
  paths for a vehicle to traverse through the open and inpainted spaces. We demonstrate
  our approach using a carâ€™s lidar data with real-time occlusions, and show that by
  inpainting occluded areas, we can plan longer paths, with more turn options compared
  to without inpainting; in addition, our approach more closely follows paths derived
  from a planner with no occlusions (called the ground truth) compared to other state
  of the art approaches.
