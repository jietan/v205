  Learning'

abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms hold the promise of enabling autonomous
  skill acquisition for robotic systems. However, in practice, real-world robotic
  RL typically requires time consuming data collection and frequent human intervention
  to reset the environment. Moreover, robotic policies learned with RL often fail
  when deployed beyond the carefully controlled setting in which they were learned.
  In this work, we study how these challenges of real-world robotic learning can all
  be tackled by effective utilization of diverse offline datasets collected from previously
  seen tasks. When faced with a new task, our system adapts previously learned skills
  to quickly learn to both perform the new task and return the environment to an initial
  state, effectively performing its own environment reset. Our empirical results demonstrate
  that incorporating prior data into robotic reinforcement learning enables autonomous
  learning, substantially improves sample-efficiency of learning, and enables better
  generalization.
