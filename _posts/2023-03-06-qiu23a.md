title: Out-of-Dynamics Imitation Learning from Multimodal Demonstrations
section: Poster
openreview: X6CjiTWVRVr
abstract: 'Existing imitation learning works mainly assume that the demonstrator who
  collects demonstrations shares the same dynamics as the imitator. However, the assumption
  limits the usage of imitation learning, especially when collecting demonstrations
  for the imitator is difficult. In this paper, we study out-of-dynamics imitation
  learning (OOD-IL), which relaxes the assumption to that the demonstrator and the
  imitator have the same state spaces but could have different action spaces and dynamics.
  OOD-IL enables imitation learning to utilize demonstrations from a wide range of
  demonstrators but introduces a new challenge: some demonstrations cannot be achieved
  by the imitator due to the different dynamics. Prior works try to filter out such
  demonstrations by feasibility measurements, but ignore the fact that the demonstrations
  exhibit a multimodal distribution since the different demonstrators may take different
  policies in different dynamics. We develop a better transferability measurement
  to tackle this newly-emerged challenge. We firstly design a novel sequence-based
  contrastive clustering algorithm to cluster demonstrations from the same mode to
  avoid the mutual interference of demonstrations from different modes, and then learn
  the transferability of each demonstration with an adversarial-learning based algorithm
  in each cluster. Experiment results on several MuJoCo environments, a driving environment,
  and a simulated robot environment show that the proposed transferability measurement
  more accurately finds and down-weights non-transferable demonstrations and outperforms
  prior works on the final imitation learning performance. We show the videos of our
  experiment results on our website.'
