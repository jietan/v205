title: Learning Multi-Object Dynamics with Compositional Neural Radiance Fields
section: Poster
openreview: qUvTmyGpnm7
abstract: 'We present a method to learn compositional multi-object dynamics models
  from image observations based on implicit object encoders, Neural Radiance Fields
  (NeRFs), and graph neural networks. NeRFs have become a popular choice for representing
  scenes due to their strong 3D prior. However, most NeRF approaches are trained on
  a single scene, representing the whole scene with a global model, making generalization
  to novel scenes, containing different numbers of objects, challenging. Instead,
  we present a compositional, object-centric auto-encoder framework that maps multiple
  views of the scene to a set of latent vectors representing each object separately.
  The latent vectors parameterize individual NeRFs from which the scene can be reconstructed.
  Based on those latent vectors, we train a graph neural network dynamics model in
  the latent space to achieve compositionality for dynamics prediction. A key feature
  of our approach is that the latent vectors are forced to encode 3D information through
  the NeRF decoder, which enables us to incorporate structural priors in learning
  the dynamics models, making long-term predictions more stable compared to several
  baselines. Simulated and real world experiments show that our method can model and
  learn the dynamics of compositional scenes including rigid and deformable objects.
