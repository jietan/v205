title: 'GLSO: Grammar-guided Latent Space Optimization for Sample-efficient Robot
  Design Automation'
section: Poster
openreview: vyR0C7zvozS
abstract: Robots have been used in all sorts of automation, and yet the design of
  robots remains mainly a manual task. We seek to provide design tools to automate
  the design of robots themselves. An important challenge in robot design automation
  is the large and complex design search space which grows exponentially with the
  number of components, making optimization difficult and sample inefficient. In this
  work, we present Grammar-guided Latent Space Optimization (GLSO), a framework that
  transforms design automation into a low-dimensional continuous optimization problem
  by training a graph variational autoencoder (VAE) to learn a mapping between the
  graph-structured design space and a continuous latent space. This transformation
  allows optimization to be conducted in a continuous latent space, where sample efficiency
  can be significantly boosted by applying algorithms such as Bayesian Optimization.
  GLSO guides training of the VAE using graph grammar rules and robot world space
  features, such that the learned latent space focus on valid robots and is easier
  for the optimization algorithm to explore. Importantly, the trained VAE can be reused
  to search for designs specialized to multiple different tasks without retraining.
  We evaluate GLSO by designing robots for a set of locomotion tasks in simulation,
  and demonstrate that our method outperforms related state-of-the-art robot design
  automation methods.
