title: Real-Time Generation of Time-Optimal Quadrotor Trajectories with Semi-Supervised
  Seq2Seq Learning
section: Poster
openreview: ZJYbW8Cwys
abstract: 'Generating time-optimal quadrotor trajectories is challenging due to the
  complex dynamics of high-speed, agile flight. In this paper, we propose a data-driven
  method for real-time time-optimal trajectory generation that is suitable for complicated
  system models. We utilize a temporal deep neural network with sequence-to-sequence
  learning to find the optimal trajectories for sequences of a variable number of
  waypoints. The model is efficiently trained in a semi-supervised manner by combining
  supervised pretraining using a minimum-snap baseline method with Bayesian optimization
  and reinforcement learning. Compared to the baseline method, the trained model generates
  up to 20 % faster trajectories at an order of magnitude less computational cost.
  The optimized trajectories are evaluated in simulation and real-world flight experiments,
  where the improvement is further demonstrated. '
