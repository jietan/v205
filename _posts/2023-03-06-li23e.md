title: 'Multi-Robot Scene Completion: Towards Task-Agnostic Collaborative Perception'
section: Poster
openreview: hW0tcXOJas2
abstract: Collaborative perception learns how to share information among multiple
  robots to perceive the environment better than individually done. Past research
  on this has been task-specific, such as detection or segmentation. Yet this leads
  to different information sharing for different tasks, hindering the large-scale
  deployment of collaborative perception. We propose the first task-agnostic collaborative
  perception paradigm that learns a single collaboration module in a self-supervised
  manner for different downstream tasks. This is done by a novel task termed multi-robot
  scene completion, where each robot learns to effectively share information for reconstructing
  a complete scene viewed by all robots. Moreover, we propose a spatiotemporal autoencoder
  (STAR) that amortizes over time the communication cost by spatial sub-sampling and
  temporal mixing. Extensive experiments validate our methodâ€™s effectiveness on scene
  completion and collaborative perception in autonomous driving scenarios. Our code
  is available at https://coperception.github.io/star/.
