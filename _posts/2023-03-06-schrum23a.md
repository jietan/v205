abstract: Endowing robots with the ability to learn novel tasks via demonstrations
  will increase the accessibility of robots for non-expert, non-roboticists. However,
  research has shown that humans can be poor teachers, making it difficult for robots
  to effectively learn from humans. If the robot could instruct humans how to provide
  better demonstrations, then humans might be able to effectively teach a broader
  range of novel, out-of-distribution tasks. In this work, we introduce Reciprocal
  MIND MELD, a framework in which the robot learns the way in which a demonstrator
  is suboptimal and utilizes this information to provide feedback to the demonstrator
  to improve upon their demonstrations. We additionally develop an Embedding Predictor
  Network which learns to predict the demonstratorâ€™s suboptimality online without
  the need for optimal labels. In a series of human-subject experiments in a driving
  simulator domain, we demonstrate that robotic feedback can effectively improve human
  demonstrations in two dimensions of suboptimality (p < .001) and that robotic feedback
  translates into better learning outcomes for a robotic agent on novel tasks (p =
  .045).
