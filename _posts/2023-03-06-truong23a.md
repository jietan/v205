title: 'Rethinking Sim2Real: Lower Fidelity Simulation Leads to Higher Sim2Real Transfer
  in Navigation'
section: Poster
openreview: BxHcg_Zlpxj
abstract: If we want to train robots in simulation before deploying them in reality,
  it seems natural and almost self-evident to presume that reducing the sim2real gap
  involves creating simulators of increasing fidelity (since reality is what it is).
  We challenge this assumption and present a contrary hypothesis – sim2real transfer
  of robots may be improved with lower (not higher) fidelity simulation. We conduct
  a systematic large-scale evaluation of this hypothesis on the problem of visual
  navigation – in the real world, and on 2 different simulators (Habitat and iGibson)
  using 3 different robots (A1, AlienGo, Spot). Our results show that, contrary to
  expectation, adding fidelity does not help with learning; performance is poor due
  to slow simulation speed (preventing large-scale learning) and overfitting to inaccuracies
  in simulation physics. Instead, building simple models of the robot motion using
  real-world data can improve learning and generalization.
