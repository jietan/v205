title: Leveraging Fully Observable Policies for Learning under Partial Observability
section: Poster
openreview: pn-HOPBioUE
abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable domains is challenging due
  to the lack of observable state information. Thankfully, learning offline in a simulator
  with such state information is often possible. In particular, we propose a method
  for partially observable reinforcement learning that uses a fully observable policy
  (which we call a \emph{state expert}) during training to improve performance. Based
  on Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our agent balances performing actions similar to the
  state expert and getting high returns under partial observability. Our approach
  can leverage the fully-observable policy for exploration and parts of the domain
  that are fully observable while still being able to learn under partial observability.
  On six robotics domains, our method outperforms pure imitation, pure reinforcement
  learning, the sequential or parallel combination of both types, and a recent state-of-the-art
  method in the same setting. A successful policy transfer to a physical robot in
  a manipulation task from pixels shows our approachâ€™s practicality in learning interesting
  policies under partial observability.
