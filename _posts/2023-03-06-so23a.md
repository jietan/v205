  Real Data'

abstract: Autonomous driving is complex, requiring sophisticated 3D scene understanding,
  localization, mapping, and control. Rather than explicitly modelling and fusing
  each of these components, we instead consider an end-to-end approach via reinforcement
  learning (RL). However, collecting exploration driving data in the real world is
  impractical and dangerous. While training in simulation and deploying visual sim-to-real
  techniques has worked well for robot manipulation, deploying beyond controlled workspace
  viewpoints remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge by presenting
  Sim2Seg, a re-imagining of RCAN that crosses the visual reality gap for off-road
  autonomous driving, without using any real-world data. This is done by learning
  to translate randomized simulation images into simulated segmentation and depth
  maps, subsequently enabling real-world images to also be translated. This allows
  us to train an end-to-end RL policy in simulation, and directly deploy in the real-world.
  Our approach, which can be trained in 48 hours on 1 GPU, can perform equally as
  well as a classical perception and control stack that took thousands of engineering
  hours over several months to build. We hope this work motivates future end-to-end
  autonomous driving research.
