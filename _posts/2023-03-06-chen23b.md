title: Learning Robust Real-World Dexterous Grasping Policies via Implicit Shape Augmentation
section: Poster
openreview: bUUf1CT1sNu
abstract: 'Dexterous robotic hands have the capability to interact with a wide variety
  of household objects. However, learning robust real world grasping policies for
  arbitrary objects has proven challenging due to the difficulty of generating high
  quality training data. In this work, we propose a learning system (\emph{ISAGrasp})
  for leveraging a small number of human demonstrations to bootstrap the generation
  of a much larger dataset containing successful grasps on a variety of novel objects.  Our
  key insight is to use a correspondence-aware implicit generative model to deform
  object meshes and demonstrated human grasps in order to create a diverse dataset
  for supervised learning, while maintaining semantic realism. We use this dataset
  to train a robust grasping policy in simulation which can be deployed in the real
  world. We demonstrate grasping performance with a four-fingered Allegro hand in
  both simulation and the real world, and show this method can handle entirely new
  semantic classes and achieve a 79% success rate on grasping unseen objects in the
  real world. '
