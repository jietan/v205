title: 'Domain Adaptation and Generalization: A Low-Complexity Approach'
section: Poster
openreview: Z8mqodASTQd
abstract: 'Well-performing deep learning methods are essential in today’s perception
  of robotic systems such as autonomous driving vehicles. Ongoing research is due
  to the real-life demands for robust deep learning models against numerous domain
  changes and cheap training processes to avoid costly manual-labeling efforts. These
  requirements are addressed by unsupervised domain adaptation methods, in particular
  for synthetic to real-world domain changes. Recent top-performing approaches are
  hybrids consisting of multiple adaptation technologies and complex training processes.   In
  contrast, this work proposes EasyAdap, a simple and easy-to-use unsupervised domain
  adaptation method achieving near state-of-the-art performance on the synthetic to
  real-world domain change. Our evaluation consists of a comparison to numerous top-performing
  methods, and it shows the competitiveness and further potential of domain adaptation
  and domain generalization capabilities of our method. We contribute and focus on
  an extensive discussion revealing possible reasons for domain generalization capabilities,
  which is necessary to satisfy real-life application’s demands. '
