title: 'ROS-PyBullet Interface: A Framework for Reliable Contact Simulation and Human-Robot
  Interaction'
section: Poster
openreview: Ag-vOezQ0Gw
abstract: Reliable contact simulation plays a key role in the development of (semi-)autonomous
  robots, especially when dealing with contact-rich manipulation scenarios, an active
  robotics research topic. Besides simulation, components such as sensing, perception,
  data collection, robot hardware control, human interfaces, etc. are all key enablers
  towards applying machine learning algorithms or model-based approaches in real world
  systems. However, there is a lack of software connecting reliable contact simulation
  with the larger robotics ecosystem (i.e. ROS, Orocos), for a more seamless application
  of novel approaches, found in the literature, to existing robotic hardware. In this
  paper, we present the ROS-PyBullet Interface, a framework that provides a bridge
  between the reliable contact/impact simulator PyBullet and the Robot Operating System
  (ROS). Furthermore, we provide additional utilities for facilitating Human-Robot
  Interaction (HRI) in the simulated environment. We also present several use-cases
  that highlight the capabilities and usefulness of our framework. Our code base is
  open source and can be found at https://github.com/ros-pybullet/ros_pybullet_interface.
