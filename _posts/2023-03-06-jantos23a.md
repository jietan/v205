title: 'PoET: Pose Estimation Transformer for Single-View, Multi-Object 6D Pose Estimation'
section: Poster
openreview: ZAbh4Zp0Blt
abstract: Accurate 6D object pose estimation is an important task for a variety of
  robotic applications such as grasping or localization. It is a challenging task
  due to object symmetries, clutter and occlusion, but it becomes more challenging
  when additional information, such as depth and 3D models, is not provided. We present
  a transformer-based approach that takes an RGB image as input and predicts a 6D
  pose for each object in the image. Besides the image, our network does not require
  any additional information such as depth maps or 3D object models. First, the image
  is passed through an object detector to generate feature maps and to detect objects.
  Then, the feature maps are fed into a transformer with the detected bounding boxes
  as additional information. Afterwards, the output object queries are processed by
  a separate translation and rotation head. We achieve state-of-the-art results for
  RGB-only approaches on the challenging YCB-V dataset. We illustrate the suitability
  of the resulting model as pose sensor for a 6-DoF state estimation task. Code is
