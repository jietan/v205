title: Learning Goal-Conditioned Policies Offline with Self-Supervised Reward Shaping
section: Poster
openreview: 8tmKW-NG2bH
abstract: Developing agents that can execute multiple skills by learning from pre-collected
  datasets is an important problem in robotics, where online interaction with the
  environment is extremely time-consuming. Moreover, manually designing reward functions
  for every single desired skill is prohibitive. Prior works targeted these challenges
  by learning goal-conditioned policies from offline datasets without manually specified
  rewards, through hindsight relabeling. These methods suffer from the issue of sparsity
  of rewards, and fail at long-horizon tasks. In this work, we propose a novel self-supervised
  learning phase on the pre-collected dataset to understand the structure and the
  dynamics of the model, and shape a dense reward function for learning policies offline.
  We evaluate our method on three continuous control tasks, and show that our model
  significantly outperforms existing approaches, especially on tasks that involve
  long-term planning.
