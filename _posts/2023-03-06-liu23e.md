title: Safe Control Under Input Limits with Neural Control Barrier Functions
section: Poster
openreview: 4ffLQu_O-Dl
abstract: 'We propose new methods to synthesize control barrier function (CBF) based
  safe controllers that avoid input saturation, which can cause safety violations.
  In particular, our method is created for high-dimensional, general nonlinear systems,
  for which such tools are scarce. We leverage techniques from machine learning, like
  neural networks and deep learning, to simplify this challenging problem in nonlinear
  control design. The method consists of a learner-critic architecture, in which the
  critic gives counterexamples of input saturation and the learner optimizes a neural
  CBF to eliminate those counterexamples. We provide empirical results on a 10D state,
  4D input quadcopter-pendulum system. Our learned CBF avoids input saturation and
  maintains safety over nearly 100% of trials. '
