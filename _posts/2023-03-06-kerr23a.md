title: 'Evo-NeRF: Evolving NeRF for Sequential Robot Grasping of Transparent Objects'
section: Oral
openreview: Bxr45keYrf
abstract: Sequential robot grasping of transparent objects, where a robot removes
  objects one by one from a workspace, is important in many industrial and household
  scenarios. We propose Evolving NeRF (Evo-NeRF), leveraging recent speedups in NeRF
  training and further extending it to rapidly train the NeRF representation concurrently
  to image capturing. Evo-NeRF terminates training early when a sufficient task confidence
  is achieved, evolves the NeRF weights from grasp to grasp to rapidly adapt to object
  removal, and applies additional geometry regularizations to make the reconstruction
  smoother and faster. General purpose grasp planners such as Dex-Net may underperform
  with NeRF outputs because there can be unreliable geometry from rapidly trained
  NeRFs. To mitigate this distribution shift, we propose a Radiance-Adjusted Grasp
  Network (RAG-Net), a grasping network adapted to NeRFâ€™s characteristics through
  training on depth rendered from NeRFs of synthetic scenes. In experiments, a physical
  YuMi robot using Evo-NeRF and RAG-Net achieves an 89% grasp success rate over 27
  trials on single objects, with early capture termination providing a 41% speed improvement
  with no loss in reliability. In a sequential grasping task on 6 scenes, Evo-NeRF
  reusing network weights clears 72% of the objects, retaining similar performance
  as reconstructing the NeRF from scratch (76%) but using 61% less sensing time. See
