title: Learning Preconditions of Hybrid Force-Velocity Controllers for Contact-Rich
  Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: CC4JMO4dzg
abstract: 'Robots need to manipulate objects in constrained environments like shelves
  and cabinets when assisting humans in everyday settings like homes and offices.
  These constraints make manipulation difficult by reducing grasp accessibility, so
  robots need to use non-prehensile strategies that leverage object-environment contacts
  to perform manipulation tasks. To tackle the challenge of planning and controlling
  contact-rich behaviors in such settings, this work uses Hybrid Force-Velocity Controllers
  (HFVCs) as the skill representation and plans skill sequences with learned preconditions.
  While HFVCs naturally enable robust and compliant contact-rich behaviors, solvers
  that synthesize them have traditionally relied on precise object models and closed-loop
  feedback on object pose, which are difficult to obtain in constrained environments
  due to occlusions. We first relax HFVCsâ€™ need for precise models and feedback with
  our HFVC synthesis framework, then learn a point-cloud-based precondition function
  to classify where HFVC executions will still be successful despite modeling inaccuracies.
  Finally, we use the learned precondition in a search-based task planner to complete
  contact-rich manipulation tasks in a shelf domain. Our method achieves a task success
  rate of $73.2%$, outperforming the $51.5%$ achieved by a baseline without the learned
  precondition. While the precondition function is trained in simulation, it can also
  transfer to a real-world setup without further fine-tuning. See supplementary materials
