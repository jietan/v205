title: 'Manipulation via Membranes: High-Resolution and Highly Deformable Tactile
  Sensing and Control'
section: Poster
openreview: ft8IeFe4-8e
abstract: 'Collocated tactile sensing is a fundamental enabling technology for dexterous
  manipulation. However, deformable sensors introduce complex dynamics between the
  robot, grasped object, and environment that must be considered for fine manipulation.
  Here, we propose a method to learn soft tactile sensor membrane dynamics that accounts
  for sensor deformations caused by the physical interaction between the grasped object
  and environment. Our method combines the perceived 3D geometry of the membrane with
  proprioceptive reaction wrenches to predict future deformations conditioned on robot
  action. Grasped object poses are recovered from membrane geometry and reaction wrenches,
  decoupling interaction dynamics from the tactile observation model. We benchmark
  our approach on two real-world contact-rich tasks: drawing with a grasped marker
  and in-hand pivoting. Our results suggest that explicitly modeling membrane dynamics
  achieves better task performance and generalization to unseen objects than baselines.'
