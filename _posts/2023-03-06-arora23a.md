title: Online Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Learned Observation Model
section: Poster
openreview: QFYq0VwBCLE
abstract: 'With the motivation of extending incremental inverse reinforcement learning
  (I2RL) to real-world robotics applications with noisy observations as well as an
  unknown observation model, we introduce a new method (RIMEO) that approximates the
  observation model in order to best estimate the noise-free ground truth underlying
  the observations. It learns a maximum entropy distribution over the observation
  features governing the perception process, and then uses the inferred observation
  model to learn the reward function. Experimental evaluation is performed in two
  robotics tasks: (1) post-harvest vegetable sorting with a Sawyer arm based on human
  demonstration, and (2) breaching a perimeter patrol by two Turtlebots. Our experiments
  reveal that RIMEO learns a more accurate policy compared to (a) a state-of-the-art
  IRL method that does not directly learn an observation model, and (b) a custom baseline
  that learns a less sophisticated observation model. Furthermore, we show that RIMEO
  admits formal guarantees of monotonic convergence and a sample complexity bound.'
