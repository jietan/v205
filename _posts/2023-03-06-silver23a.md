title: Learning Neuro-Symbolic Skills for Bilevel Planning
section: Poster
openreview: OIaJRUo5UXy
abstract: Decision-making is challenging in robotics environments with continuous
  object-centric states, continuous actions, long horizons, and sparse feedback. Hierarchical
  approaches, such as task and motion planning (TAMP), address these challenges by
  decomposing decision-making into two or more levels of abstraction. In a setting
  where demonstrations and symbolic predicates are given, prior work has shown how
  to learn symbolic operators and neural samplers for TAMP with manually designed
  parameterized policies. Our main contribution is a method for learning parameterized
  polices in combination with operators and samplers. These components are packaged
  into modular neuro-symbolic skills and sequenced together with search-then-sample
  TAMP to solve new tasks. In experiments in four robotics domains, we show that our
  approach — bilevel planning with neuro-symbolic skills — can solve a wide range
  of tasks with varying initial states, goals, and objects, outperforming six baselines
  and ablations.
