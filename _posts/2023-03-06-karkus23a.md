title: 'DiffStack: A Differentiable and Modular Control Stack for Autonomous Vehicles'
section: Poster
openreview: teEnA3L4aRe
abstract: Autonomous vehicle (AV) stacks are typically built in a modular fashion,
  with explicit components performing detection, tracking, prediction, planning, control,
  etc. While modularity improves reusability, interpretability, and generalizability,
  it also suffers from compounding errors, information bottlenecks, and integration
  challenges. To overcome these challenges, a prominent approach is to convert the
  AV stack into an end-to-end neural network and train it with data. While such approaches
  have achieved impressive results, they typically lack interpretability and reusability,
  and they eschew principled analytical components, such as planning and control,
  in favor of deep neural networks. To enable the joint optimization of AV stacks
  while retaining modularity, we present DiffStack, a differentiable and modular stack
  for prediction, planning, and control. Crucially, our model-based planning and control
  algorithms leverage recent advancements in differentiable optimization to produce
  gradients, enabling optimization of upstream components, such as prediction, via
  backpropagation through planning and control. Our results on the nuScenes dataset
  indicate that end-to-end training with DiffStack yields substantial improvements
  in open-loop and closed-loop planning metrics by, e.g., learning to make fewer prediction
  errors that would affect planning. Beyond these immediate benefits, DiffStack opens
  up new opportunities for fully data-driven yet modular and interpretable AV architectures.
