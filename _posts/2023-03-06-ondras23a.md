abstract: We develop data-driven models to predict when a robot should feed during
  social dining scenarios. Being able to eat independently with friends and family
  is considered one of the most memorable and important activities for people with
  mobility limitations. While existing robotic systems for feeding people with mobility
  limitations focus on solitary dining, commensality, the act of eating together,
  is often the practice of choice. Sharing meals with others introduces the problem
  of socially appropriate bite timing for a robot, i.e. the appropriate timing for
  the robot to feed without disrupting the social dynamics of a shared meal. Our key
  insight is that bite timing strategies that take into account the delicate balance
  of social cues can lead to seamless interactions during robot-assisted feeding in
  a social dining scenario. We approach this problem by collecting a Human-Human Commensality
  Dataset (HHCD) containing 30 groups of three people eating together. We use this
  dataset to analyze human-human commensality behaviors and develop bite timing prediction
  models in social dining scenarios. We also transfer these models to human-robot
  commensality scenarios. Our user studies show that prediction improves when our
  algorithm uses multimodal social signaling cues between diners to model bite timing.
