title: 'DexPoint: Generalizable Point Cloud Reinforcement Learning for Sim-to-Real
  Dexterous Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: tJE1Yyi8fUX
abstract: 'We propose a sim-to-real framework for dexterous manipulation which can
  generalize to new objects of the same category in the real world. The key of our
  framework is to train the manipulation policy with point cloud inputs and dexterous
  hands. We propose two new techniques to enable joint learning on multiple objects
  and sim-to-real generalization: (i) using imagined hand point clouds as augmented
  inputs; and (ii) designing novel contact-based rewards. We empirically evaluate
  our method using an Allegro Hand to grasp novel objects in both simulation and real
  world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first policy learning-based framework
  that achieves such generalization results with dexterous hands. Our project page
  is available at https://yzqin.github.io/dexpoint.'
