title: Inferring Versatile Behavior from Demonstrations by Matching Geometric Descriptors
section: Poster
openreview: Mzqn__AxyA6
abstract: Humans intuitively solve tasks in versatile ways, varying their behavior
  in terms of trajectory-based planning and for individual steps. Thus, they can easily
  generalize and adapt to new and changing environments. Current Imitation Learning
  algorithms often only consider unimodal expert demonstrations and act in a state-action-based
  setting, making it difficult for them to imitate human behavior in case of versatile
  demonstrations. Instead, we combine a mixture of movement primitives with a distribution
  matching objective to learn versatile behaviors that match the expert’s behavior
  and versatility. To facilitate generalization to novel task configurations, we do
  not directly match the agent’s and expert’s trajectory distributions but rather
  work with concise geometric descriptors which generalize well to unseen task configurations.
  We empirically validate our method on various robot tasks using versatile human
  demonstrations and compare to imitation learning algorithms in a state-action setting
  as well as a trajectory-based setting. We find that the geometric descriptors greatly
  help in generalizing to new task configurations and that combining them with our
  distribution-matching objective is crucial for representing and reproducing versatile
  behavior.
