title: 'MegaPose: 6D Pose Estimation of Novel Objects via Render & Compare'
section: Poster
openreview: 1zbWQxFIU-
abstract: 'We introduce MegaPose, a method to estimate the 6D pose of novel objects,
  that is, objects unseen during training. At inference time, the method only assumes
  knowledge of (i) a region of interest displaying the object in the image and (ii)
  a CAD model of the observed object. The contributions of this work are threefold.
  First, we present a 6D pose refiner based on a render&compare strategy which can
  be applied to novel objects. The shape and coordinate system of the novel object
  are provided as inputs to the network by rendering multiple synthetic views of the
  object’s CAD model. Second, we introduce a novel approach for coarse pose estimation
  which leverages a network trained to classify whether the pose error between a synthetic
  rendering and an observed image of the same object can be corrected by the refiner.
  Third, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of photorealistic images of
  thousands of objects with diverse visual and shape properties and show that this
  diversity is crucial to obtain good generalization performance on novel objects.
  We train our approach on this large synthetic dataset and apply it without retraining
  to hundreds of novel objects in real images from several pose estimation benchmarks.
  Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ModelNet and YCB-Video
  datasets. An extensive evaluation on the 7 core datasets of the BOP challenge demonstrates
  that our approach achieves performance competitive with existing approaches that
  require access to the target objects during training. Code, dataset and trained
  models are available on the project page: https://megapose6d.github.io/.'
