title: 'Generalization with Lossy Affordances: Leveraging Broad Offline Data for Learning
  Visuomotor Tasks'
section: Oral
openreview: esOrVR_8-rc
abstract: The use of broad datasets has proven to be crucial for generalization for
  a wide range of fields. However, how to effectively make use of diverse multi-task
  data for novel downstream tasks still remains a grand challenge in reinforcement
  learning and robotics. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a framework that acquires
  goal-conditioned policies for unseen temporally extended tasks via offline reinforcement
  learning on broad data, in combination with online fine-tuning guided by subgoals
  in a learned lossy representation space. When faced with a novel task goal, our
  framework uses an affordance model to plan a sequence of lossy representations as
  subgoals that decomposes the original task into easier problems. Learned from the
  broad prior data, the lossy representation emphasizes task-relevant information
  about states and goals while abstracting away redundant contexts that hinder generalization.
  It thus enables subgoal planning for unseen tasks, provides a compact input to the
  policy, and facilitates reward shaping during fine-tuning. We show that our framework
  can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets of robot experience from prior work and
  efficiently fine-tuned for novel tasks, entirely from visual inputs without any
  manual reward engineering.
