title: 'BusyBot: Learning to Interact, Reason, and Plan in a BusyBoard Environment'
section: Poster
openreview: A5l7wE2uqtM
abstract: We introduce BusyBoard, a toy-inspired robot learning environment that leverages
  a diverse set of articulated objects and inter-object functional relations to provide
  rich visual feedback for robot interactions. Based on this environment, we introduce
  a learning framework, BusyBot, which allows an agent to jointly acquire three fundamental
  capabilities (interaction, reasoning, and planning) in an integrated and self-supervised
  manner. With the rich sensory feedback provided by BusyBoard, BusyBot first learns
  a policy to efficiently interact with the environment; then with data collected
  using the policy, BusyBot reasons the inter-object functional relations through
  a causal discovery network; and finally by combining the learned interaction policy
  and relation reasoning skill, the agent is able to perform goal-conditioned manipulation
  tasks. We evaluate BusyBot in both simulated and real-world environments, and validate
  its generalizability to unseen objects and relations.
