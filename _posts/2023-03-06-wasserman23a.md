title: Last-Mile Embodied Visual Navigation
section: Poster
openreview: RgJwDQwW82y
abstract: Realistic long-horizon tasks like image-goal navigation involve exploratory
  and exploitative phases. Assigned with an image of the goal, an embodied agent must
  explore to discover the goal, i.e., search efficiently using learned priors. Once
  the goal is discovered, the agent must accurately calibrate the last-mile of navigation
  to the goal. As with any robust system, switches between exploratory goal discovery
  and exploitative last-mile navigation enable better recovery from errors. Following
  these intuitive guide rails, we propose SLING to improve the performance of existing
  image-goal navigation systems. Entirely complementing prior methods, we focus on
  last-mile navigation and leverage the underlying geometric structure of the problem
  with neural descriptors. With simple but effective switches, we can easily connect
  SLING with heuristic, reinforcement learning, and neural modular policies. On a
  standardized image-goal navigation benchmark (Hahn et al. 2021), we improve performance
  across policies, scenes, and episode complexity, raising the state-of-the-art from
  45% to 55% success rate. Beyond photorealistic simulation, we conduct real-robot
  experiments in three physical scenes and find these improvements to transfer well
  to real environments.
