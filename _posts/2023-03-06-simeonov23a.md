title: SE(3)-Equivariant Relational Rearrangement with Neural Descriptor Fields
section: Poster
openreview: LunGpKUNIR
abstract: We present a framework for specifying tasks involving spatial relations
  between objects using only 5-10 demonstrations and then executing such tasks given
  point cloud observations of a novel pair of objects in arbitrary initial poses.
  Our approach structures these rearrangement tasks by assigning a consistent local
  coordinate frame to the task-relevant object parts, localizing the corresponding
  coordinate frame on unseen object instances, and executing an action that brings
  these frames into alignment. We propose an optimization method that uses multiple
  Neural Descriptor Fields (NDFs) and a single annotated 3D keypoint to assign a set
  of consistent coordinate frames to the task-relevant object parts. We also propose
  an energy-based learning scheme to model the joint configuration of the objects
  that satisfies a desired relational task. We validate our pipeline on three multi-object
  rearrangement tasks in simulation and on a real robot. Results show that our method
  can infer relative transformations that satisfy the desired relation between novel
  objects in unseen initial poses using just a few demonstrations.
