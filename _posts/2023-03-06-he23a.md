title: Learning Representations that Enable Generalization in Assistive Tasks
section: Poster
openreview: b88HF4vd_ej
abstract: 'Recent work in sim2real has successfully enabled robots to act in physical
  environments by training in simulation with a diverse “population” of environments
  (i.e. domain randomization). In this work, we focus on enabling generalization in
  \emph{assistive tasks}: tasks in which the robot is acting to assist a user (e.g.
  helping someone with motor impairments with bathing or with scratching an itch).
  Such tasks are particularly interesting relative to prior sim2real successes because
  the environment now contains a \emph{human who is also acting}. This complicates
  the problem because the diversity of human users (instead of merely physical environment
  parameters) is more difficult to capture in a population, thus increasing the likelihood
  of encountering out-of-distribution (OOD) human policies at test time. We advocate
  that generalization to such OOD policies benefits from (1) learning a good latent
  representation for human policies that test-time humans can accurately be mapped
  to, and (2) making that representation adaptable with test-time interaction data,
  instead of relying on it to perfectly capture the space of human policies based
  on the simulated population only. We study how to best learn such a representation
  by evaluating on purposefully constructed OOD test policies. We find that sim2real
  methods that encode environment (or population) parameters and work well in tasks
  that robots do in isolation, do not work well in \emph{assistance}.  In assistance,
  it seems crucial to train the representation based on the \emph{history of interaction}
  directly, because that is what the robot will have access to at test time. Further,
  training these representations to then \emph{predict human actions} not only gives
  them better structure, but also enables them to be fine-tuned at test-time, when
  the robot observes the partner act.'
