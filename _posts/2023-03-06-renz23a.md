title: 'PlanT: Explainable Planning Transformers via Object-Level Representations'
section: Poster
openreview: 80vpxjt3vq
abstract: Planning an optimal route in a complex environment requires efficient reasoning
  about the surrounding scene. While human drivers prioritize important objects and
  ignore details not relevant to the decision, learning-based planners typically extract
  features from dense, high-dimensional grid representations containing all vehicle
  and road context information. In this paper, we propose PlanT, a novel approach
  for planning in the context of self-driving that uses a standard transformer architecture.
  PlanT is based on imitation learning with a compact object-level input representation.
  On the Longest6 benchmark for CARLA, PlanT outperforms all prior methods (matching
  the driving score of the expert) while being 5.3Ã— faster than equivalent pixel-based
  planning baselines during inference. Combining PlanT with an off-the-shelf perception
  module provides a sensor-based driving system that is more than 10 points better
  in terms of driving score than the existing state of the art. Furthermore, we propose
  an evaluation protocol to quantify the ability of planners to identify relevant
  objects, providing insights regarding their decision-making. Our results indicate
  that PlanT can focus on the most relevant object in the scene, even when this object
  is geometrically distant.
