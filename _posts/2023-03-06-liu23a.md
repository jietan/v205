title: Vision-based Uneven BEV Representation Learning with Polar Rasterization and
  Surface Estimation
section: Poster
openreview: SM70KHTBG-0
abstract: In this work, we propose PolarBEV  for vision-based uneven BEV representation
  learning. To adapt to the foreshortening effect of camera imaging, we rasterize
  the BEV space both angularly and radially, and introduce polar embedding decomposition
  to model the associations among polar grids.  Polar grids are rearranged to an array-like
  regular representation for efficient processing. Besides, to determine the 2D-to-3D
  correspondence, we iteratively update the BEV surface based on a hypothetical plane,
  and adopt height-based  feature transformation. PolarBEV keeps real-time inference
  speed on a single 2080Ti GPU, and outperforms other methods for both BEV semantic
  segmentation and BEV instance segmentation. Thorough ablations  are presented to
  validate the design. The code will be released for facilitating further research.
