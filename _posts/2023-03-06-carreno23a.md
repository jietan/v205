title: Adapting Neural Models with Sequential Monte Carlo Dropout
section: Poster
openreview: Y7xQsyGEQ0C
abstract: 'The ability to adapt to changing environments and settings is essential
  for robots acting in dynamic and unstructured environments or working alongside
  humans with varied abilities or preferences. This work introduces an extremely simple
  and effective approach to adapting neural models in response to changing settings,
  without requiring any specialised meta-learning strategies. We first train a standard
  network using dropout, which is analogous to learning an ensemble of predictive
  models or distribution over predictions. At run-time, we use a particle filter to
  maintain a distribution over dropout masks to adapt the neural model to changing
  settings in an online manner. Experimental results show improved performance in
  control problems requiring both online and look-ahead prediction, and showcase the
  interpretability of the inferred masks in a human behaviour modelling task for drone
  tele-operation. '
