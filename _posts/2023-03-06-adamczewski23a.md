title: Lidar Line Selection with Spatially-Aware Shapley Value for Cost-Efficient
  Depth Completion
section: Poster
openreview: gOW9pdOeqUc
abstract: Lidar is a vital sensor for estimating the depth of a scene. Typical spinning
  lidars emit pulses arranged in several horizontal lines and the monetary cost of
  the sensor increases with the number of these lines. In this work, we present the
  new problem of optimizing the positioning of lidar lines to find the most effective
  configuration for the depth completion task. We propose a solution to reduce the
  number of lines while retaining the up-to-the-mark quality of depth completion.
  Our method consists of two components, (1) line selection based on the marginal
  contribution of a line computed via the Shapley value and (2) incorporating line
  position spread to take into account its need to arrive at image-wide depth completion.
  Spatially-aware Shapley values (SaS) succeed in selecting line subsets that yield
  a depth accuracy comparable to the full lidar input while using just half of the
  lines.
