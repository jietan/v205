title: 'Do As I Can, Not As I Say: Grounding Language in Robotic Affordances'
section: Oral
openreview: bdHkMjBJG_w
abstract: Large language models can encode a wealth of semantic knowledge about the
  world. Such knowledge could be extremely useful to robots aiming to act upon high-level,
  temporally extended instructions expressed in natural language. However, a significant
  weakness of language models is that they lack real-world experience, which makes
  it difficult to leverage them for decision making within a given embodiment. For
  example, asking a language model to describe how to clean a spill might result in
  a reasonable narrative, but it may not be applicable to a particular agent, such
  as a robot, that needs to perform this task in a particular environment. We propose
  to provide real-world grounding by means of pretrained skills, which are used to
  constrain the model to propose natural language actions that are both feasible and
  contextually appropriate. The robot can act as the language model’s “hands and eyes,”
  while the language model supplies high-level semantic knowledge about the task.
  We show how low-level skills can be combined with large language models so  that  the  language
  model  provides  high-level  knowledge about the procedures for performing complex
  and temporally extended instructions,  while  value  functions  associated  with  these  skills  provide  the  grounding
  necessary to connect this knowledge to a particular physical environment. We evaluate
  our method on a number of real-world robotic tasks, where we show the need for real-world
  grounding and that this approach is capable of completing long-horizon, abstract,
  natural language instructions on a mobile manipulator. The project’s website, video,
  and open source can be found at say-can.github.io.
