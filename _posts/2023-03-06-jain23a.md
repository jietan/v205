title: Transformers Are Adaptable Task Planners
section: Poster
openreview: Eal_lL08v_l
abstract: Every home is different, and every person likes things done in their particular
  way. Therefore, home robots of the future need to both reason about the sequential
  nature of day-to-day tasks and generalize to userâ€™s preferences. To this end, we
  propose a Transformer Task Planner (TTP) that learns high-level actions from demonstrations
  by leveraging object attribute-based representations. TTP can be pre-trained on
  multiple preferences and shows generalization to unseen preferences using a single
  demonstration as a prompt in a simulated dishwasher loading task. Further, we demonstrate
  real-world dish rearrangement using TTP with a Franka Panda robotic arm, prompted
  using a single human demonstration.
