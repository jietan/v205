title: Representation Learning for Object Detection from Unlabeled Point Cloud Sequences
section: Poster
openreview: nuAGobCwb8V
abstract: 'Although unlabeled 3D data is easy to collect, state-of-the-art machine
  learning techniques for 3D object detection still rely on difficult-to-obtain manual
  annotations. To reduce dependence on the expensive and error-prone process of manual
  labeling, we propose a technique for representation learning from unlabeled LiDAR
  point cloud sequences. Our key insight is that moving objects can be reliably detected
  from point cloud sequences without the need for human-labeled 3D bounding boxes.
  In a single LiDAR frame extracted from a sequence, the set of moving objects provides
  sufficient supervision for single-frame object detection. By designing appropriate
  pretext tasks, we learn point cloud features that generalize to both moving and
  static unseen objects. We apply these features to object detection, achieving strong
  performance on self-supervised representation learning and unsupervised object detection
  tasks. '
