title: Laplace Approximation Based Epistemic Uncertainty Estimation in 3D Object Detection
section: Poster
openreview: u4QXJbcvx8u
abstract: Understanding the uncertainty of predictions is a desirable feature for
  perceptual modules in critical robotic applications. 3D object detectors are neural
  networks with high-dimensional output space. It suffers from poor calibration in
  classification and lacks reliable uncertainty estimation in regression. To provide
  a reliable epistemic uncertainty estimation, we tailor Laplace approximation for
  3D object detectors, and propose an Uncertainty Separation and Aggregation pipeline
  for Bayesian inference. The proposed Laplace-approximation approach can easily convert
  a deterministic 3D object detector into a Bayesian neural network capable of estimating
  epistemic uncertainty. The experiment results on the KITTI dataset empirically validate
  the effectiveness of our proposed methods, and demonstrate that Laplace approximation
  performs better uncertainty quality than Monte-Carlo Dropout, DeepEnsembles, and
  deterministic models.
