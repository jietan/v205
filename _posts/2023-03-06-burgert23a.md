title: 'TRITON: Neural Neural Textures for Better Sim2Real'
section: Poster
openreview: Go64YOmGwxM
abstract: 'Unpaired image translation algorithms can be used for sim2real tasks, but
  many fail to generate temporally consistent results. We present a new approach that
  combines differentiable rendering with image translation to achieve temporal consistency
  over indefinite timescales, using surface consistency losses and neu- ral neural
  textures. We call this algorithm TRITON (Texture Recovering Image Translation Network):
  an unsupervised, end-to-end, stateless sim2real algorithm that leverages the underlying
  3D geometry of input scenes by generating realistic- looking learnable neural textures.
  By settling on a particular texture for the objects in a scene, we ensure consistency
  between frames statelessly. TRITON is not lim- ited to camera movements â€” it can
  handle the movement and deformation of ob- jects as well, making it useful for downstream
  tasks such as robotic manipulation. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach
  both qualitatively and quantita- tively, using robotic experiments and comparisons
  to ground truth photographs. We show that TRITON generates more useful images than
  other algorithms do. Please see our project website: tritonpaper.github.io'
