title: Learning to Grasp the Ungraspable with Emergent Extrinsic Dexterity
section: Oral
openreview: xK-UtqDpD7L
abstract: 'A simple gripper can solve more complex manipulation tasks if it can utilize
  the external environment such as pushing the object against the table or a vertical
  wall, known as "Extrinsic Dexterity." Previous work in extrinsic dexterity usually
  has careful assumptions about contacts which impose restrictions on robot design,
  robot motions, and the variations of the physical parameters. In this work, we develop
  a system based on reinforcement learning (RL) to address these limitations. We study
  the task of "Occluded Grasping" which aims to grasp the object in configurations
  that are initially occluded; the robot needs to move the object into a configuration
  from which these grasps can be achieved. We present a system with model-free RL
  that successfully achieves this task using a simple gripper with extrinsic dexterity.
  The policy learns emergent behaviors of pushing the object against the wall to rotate
  and then grasp it without additional reward terms on extrinsic dexterity. We discuss
  important components of the system including the design of the RL problem, multi-grasp
  training and selection, and policy generalization with automatic curriculum. Most
  importantly, the policy trained in simulation is zero-shot transferred to a physical
  robot. It demonstrates dynamic and contact-rich motions with a simple gripper that
  generalizes across objects with various size, density, surface friction, and shape
  with a 78% success rate. '
