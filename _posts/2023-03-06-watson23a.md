title: 'Inferring Smooth Control: Monte Carlo Posterior Policy Iteration with Gaussian
  Processes'
section: Oral
openreview: HbGgF93Ppoy
abstract: Monte Carlo methods have become increasingly relevant for control of non-differentiable
  systems, approximate dynamics models, and learning from data.These methods scale
  to high-dimensional spaces and are effective at the non-convex optimization often
  seen in robot learning. We look at sample-based methods from the perspective of
  inference-based control, specifically posterior policy iteration. From this perspective,
  we highlight how Gaussian noise priors produce rough control actions that are unsuitable
  for physical robot deployment. Considering smoother Gaussian process priors, as
  used in episodic reinforcement learning and motion planning, we demonstrate how
  smoother model predictive control can be achieved using online sequential inference.
  This inference is realized through an efficient factorization of the action distribution,
  and novel means of optimizing the likelihood temperature for to improve importance
  sampling accuracy. We evaluate this approach on several high-dimensional robot control
  tasks, matching the sample efficiency of prior heuristic methods while also ensuring
  smoothness. Simulation results can be seen at monte-carlo-ppi.github.io.
