section: Poster
openreview: qUhkhHw8Dz
abstract: 'To build general robotic agents that can operate in many environments,
  it is often imperative for the robot to collect experience in the real world.  However,
  this is often not feasible due to safety, time and hardware restrictions.  We thus
  propose leveraging the next best thing as real world experience: internet videos
  of humans using their hands.  Visual priors, such as visual features, are often
  learned from videos, but we believe that more information from videos can be utilized
  as a stronger prior.  We build a learning algorithm, Videodex, that leverages visual,
  action and physical priors from human video datasets to guide robot behavior.  These
  action and physical priors in the neural network dictate the typical human behavior
  for a particular robot task.   We test our approach on a robot arm and dexterous
  hand based system and show strong results on many different manipulation tasks,
  outperforming various state-of-the-art methods. For videos and supplemental material
