title: Proactive Robot Assistance via Spatio-Temporal Object Modeling
section: Poster
openreview: th7GW868Pok
abstract: Proactive robot assistance enables a robot to anticipate and provide for
  a userâ€™s needs without being explicitly asked. We formulate proactive assistance
  as the problem of the robot anticipating temporal patterns of object movements associated
  with everyday user routines, and proactively assisting the user by placing objects
  to adapt the environment to their needs. We introduce a generative graph neural
  network to learn a unified spatio-temporal predictive model of object dynamics from
  temporal sequences of object arrangements. We additionally contribute the Household
  Object Movements from Everyday Routines (HOMER) dataset, which tracks household
  objects associated with human activities of daily living across 50+ days for five
  simulated households. Our model outperforms the leading baseline in predicting object
  movement, correctly predicting locations for 11.1% more objects and wrongly predicting
  locations for 11.5% fewer objects used by the human user.
