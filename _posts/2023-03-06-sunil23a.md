title: Visuotactile Affordances for Cloth Manipulation with Local Control
section: Poster
openreview: s6NEzqZKaP-
abstract: Cloth in the real world is often crumpled, self-occluded, or folded in on
  itself such that key regions, such as corners, are not directly graspable, making
  manipulation difficult. We propose a system that leverages visual and tactile perception
  to unfold the cloth via grasping and sliding on edges. Doing so, the robot is able
  to grasp two adjacent corners, enabling subsequent manipulation tasks like folding
  or hanging. We develop tactile perception networks that classify whether an edge
  is grasped and estimate the pose of the edge. We use the edge classification network
  to supervise a visuotactile edge grasp affordance network that can grasp edges with
  a 90% success rate. Once an edge is grasped, we demonstrate that the robot can slide
  along the cloth to the adjacent corner using tactile pose estimation/control in
  real time.
