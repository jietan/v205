title: 'Inner Monologue: Embodied Reasoning through Planning with Language Models'
section: Poster
openreview: 3R3Pz5i0tye
abstract: 'Recent works have shown how the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
  Models (LLMs) can be applied to domains beyond natural language processing, such
  as planning and interaction for robots. These embodied problems require an agent
  to understand many semantic aspects of the world: the repertoire of skills available,
  how these skills influence the world, and how changes to the world map back to the
  language. LLMs planning in embodied environments need to consider not just what
  skills to do, but also how and when to do them - answers that change over time in
  response to the agentâ€™s own choices. In this work, we investigate to what extent
  LLMs used in such embodied contexts can reason over sources of feedback provided
  through natural language, without any additional training. We propose that by leveraging
  environment feedback, LLMs are able to form an inner monologue that allows them
  to more richly process and plan in robotic control scenarios. We investigate a variety
  of sources of feedback, such as success detection, scene description, and human
  interaction. We find that closed-loop language feedback significantly improves high
  level instruction completion on three domains, including simulated and real table
  top rearrangement tasks and long-horizon mobile manipulation tasks in a kitchen
  environment in the real world.'
