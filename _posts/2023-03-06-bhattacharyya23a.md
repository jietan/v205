title: 'SSL-Lanes: Self-Supervised Learning for Motion Forecasting in Autonomous Driving'
section: Poster
openreview: fXMV2CEwNVo
abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is an emerging technique that has been successfully
  employed to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks
  (GNNs) for more transferable, generalizable, and robust representation learning.
  However its potential in motion forecasting for autonomous driving has rarely been
  explored. In this study, we report the first systematic exploration and assessment
  of incorporating self-supervision into motion forecasting. We first propose to investigate
  four novel self-supervised learning tasks for motion forecasting with theoretical
  rationale and quantitative and qualitative comparisons on the challenging large-scale
  Argoverse dataset. Secondly, we point out that our auxiliary SSL-based learning
  setup not only outperforms forecasting methods which use transformers, complicated
  fusion mechanisms and sophisticated online dense goal candidate optimization algorithms
  in terms of performance accuracy, but also has low inference time and architectural
  complexity. Lastly, we conduct several experiments to understand why SSL improves
  motion forecasting.
