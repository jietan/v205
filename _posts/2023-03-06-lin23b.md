title: Planning with Spatial-Temporal Abstraction from Point Clouds for Deformable
  Object Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: tyxyBj2w4vw
abstract: 'Effective planning of long-horizon deformable object manipulation requires
  suitable abstractions at both the spatial and temporal levels. Previous methods
  typically either focus on short-horizon tasks or make strong assumptions that full-state
  information is available, which prevents their use on deformable objects. In this
  paper, we propose PlAnning with Spatial-Temporal Abstraction (PASTA), which incorporates
  both spatial abstraction (reasoning about objects and their relations to each other)
  and temporal abstraction (reasoning over skills instead of low-level actions). Our
  framework maps high-dimension 3D observations such as point clouds into a set of
  latent vectors and plans over skill sequences on top of the latent set representation.
  We show that our method can effectively perform  challenging sequential deformable
  object manipulation tasks in the real world, which require combining multiple tool-use
  skills such as cutting with a knife, pushing with a pusher, and spreading dough
  with a roller. Additional materials can be found at our project website: https://sites.google.com/view/pasta-plan.'
