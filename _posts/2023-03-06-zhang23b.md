title: Learning Riemannian Stable Dynamical Systems via Diffeomorphisms
section: Poster
openreview: o8dLx8OVcNk
abstract: Dexterous and autonomous robots should be capable of executing elaborated
  dynamical motions skillfully. Learning techniques may be leveraged to build models
  of such dynamic skills. To accomplish this, the learning model needs to encode a
  stable vector field that resembles the desired motion dynamics. This is challenging
  as the robot state does not evolve on a Euclidean space, and therefore the stability
  guarantees and vector field encoding need to account for the geometry arising from,
  for example, the orientation representation. To tackle this problem, we propose
  learning Riemannian stable dynamical systems (RSDS) from demonstrations, allowing
  us to account for different geometric constraints resulting from the dynamical system
  state representation. Our approach provides Lyapunov-stability guarantees on Riemannian
  manifolds that are enforced on the desired motion dynamics via diffeomorphisms built
  on neural manifold ODEs. We show that our Riemannian approach makes it possible
  to learn stable dynamical systems displaying complicated vector fields on both illustrative
  examples and real-world manipulation tasks, where Euclidean approximations fail.
