title: Discriminator-Guided Model-Based Offline Imitation Learning
section: Poster
openreview: RzhhFh4rkWu
abstract: Offline imitation learning (IL) is a powerful method to solve decision-making
  problems from expert demonstrations without reward labels. Existing offline IL methods
  suffer from severe performance degeneration under limited expert data. Including
  a learned dynamics model can potentially improve the state-action space coverage
  of expert data, however, it also faces challenging issues like model approximation/generalization
  errors and suboptimality of rollout data. In this paper, we propose the Discriminator-guided
  Model-based offline Imitation Learning (DMIL) framework, which introduces a discriminator
  to simultaneously distinguish the dynamics correctness and sub-optimality of model
  rollout data against real expert demonstrations. DMIL adopts a novel cooperative-yet-adversarial
  learning strategy, which uses the discriminator to guide and couple the learning
  process of the policy and dynamics model, resulting in improved model performance
  and robustness. Our framework can also be extended to the case when demonstrations
  contain a large proportion of suboptimal data. Experimental results show that DMIL
  and its extension achieve superior performance and robustness compared to state-of-the-art
  offline IL methods under small datasets.
