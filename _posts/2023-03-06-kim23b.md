title: SE(2)-Equivariant Pushing Dynamics Models for Tabletop Object Manipulations
section: Oral
openreview: 4g3PwAp5nsX
abstract: For tabletop object manipulation tasks, learning an accurate pushing dynamics
  model, which predicts the objects’ motions when a robot pushes an object, is very
  important. In this work, we claim that an ideal pushing dynamics model should have
  the SE(2)-equivariance property, i.e., if tabletop objects’ poses and pushing action
  are transformed by some same planar rigid-body transformation, then the resulting
  motion should also be the result of the same transformation. Existing state-of-the-art
  data-driven approaches do not have this equivariance property, resulting in less-than-desirable
  learning performances. In this paper, we propose a new neural network architecture
  that by construction has the above equivariance property. Through extensive empirical
  validations, we show that the proposed model shows significantly improved learning
  performances over the existing methods. Also, we verify that our pushing dynamics
  model can be used for various downstream pushing manipulation tasks such as the
  object moving, singulation, and grasping in both simulation and real robot experiments.
