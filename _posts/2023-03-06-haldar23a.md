title: 'Watch and Match: Supercharging Imitation with Regularized Optimal Transport'
section: Oral
openreview: ZUtgUA0Fuwd
abstract: Imitation learning holds tremendous promise in learning policies efficiently
  for complex decision making problems. Current state-of-the-art algorithms often
  use inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), where given a set of expert demonstrations,
  an agent alternatively infers a reward function and the associated optimal policy.
  However, such IRL approaches often require substantial online interactions for complex
  control problems. In this work, we present Regularized Optimal Transport (ROT),
  a new imitation learning algorithm that builds on recent advances in optimal transport
  based trajectory-matching. Our key technical insight is that adaptively combining
  trajectory-matching rewards with behavior cloning can significantly accelerate imitation
  even with only a few demonstrations. Our experiments on 20 visual control tasks
  across the DeepMind Control Suite, the OpenAI Robotics Suite, and the Meta-World
  Benchmark demonstrate an average of 7.8x faster imitation to reach 90% of expert
  performance compared to prior state-of-the-art methods. On real-world robotic manipulation,
  with just one demonstration and an hour of online training, ROT achieves an average
  success rate of 90.1% across 14 tasks.
