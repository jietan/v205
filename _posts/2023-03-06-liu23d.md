title: 'Frame Mining: a Free Lunch for Learning Robotic Manipulation from 3D Point
  Clouds'
section: Poster
openreview: d-JYso87y6s
abstract: " We study how choices of input point cloud coordinate frames impact learning
  of manipulation skills from 3D point clouds. There exist a variety of coordinate
  frame choices to normalize captured robot-object-interaction point clouds. We find
  that different frames have a profound effect on agent learning performance, and
  the trend is similar across 3D backbone networks. In particular, the end-effector
  frame and the target-part frame achieve higher training efficiency than the commonly
  used world frame and robot-base frame in many tasks, intuitively because they provide
  helpful alignments among point clouds across time steps and thus can simplify visual
  module learning. Moreover, the well-performing frames vary across tasks, and some
  tasks may benefit from multiple frame candidates. We thus propose FrameMiners to
  adaptively select candidate frames and fuse their merits in a task-agnostic manner.
  Experimentally, FrameMiners achieves on-par or significantly higher performance
  than the best single-frame version on five fully physical manipulation tasks adapted
  from ManiSkill and OCRTOC. Without changing existing camera placements or adding
  extra cameras, point cloud frame mining can serve as a free lunch to improve 3D
  manipulation learning."
