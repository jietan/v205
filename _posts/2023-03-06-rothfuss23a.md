title: Meta-Learning Priors for Safe Bayesian Optimization
section: Oral
openreview: zNB_UVj5oKQ
abstract: 'In robotics, optimizing controller parameters under safety constraints
  is an important challenge. Safe Bayesian optimization (BO) quantifies uncertainty
  in the objective and constraints to safely guide exploration in such settings. Hand-designing
  a suitable probabilistic model can be challenging however. In the presence of unknown
  safety constraints, it is crucial to choose reliable model hyper-parameters to avoid
  safety violations. Here, we propose a data-driven approach to this problem by em
  meta-learning priors for safe BO from offline data. We build on a meta-learning
  algorithm, F-PACOH, capable of providing reliable uncertainty quantification in
  settings of data scarcity. As core contribution, we develop a novel framework for
  choosing safety-compliant priors in a data-riven manner via empirical uncertainty
  metrics and a frontier search algorithm. On benchmark functions and a high-precision
  motion system, we demonstrate that our meta-learnt priors accelerate convergence
  of safe BO approaches while maintaining safety. '
