title: 'INQUIRE: INteractive Querying for User-aware Informative REasoning'
section: Poster
openreview: 3CQ3Vt0v99
abstract: Research on Interactive Robot Learning has yielded several modalities for
  querying a human for training data, including demonstrations, preferences, and corrections.
  While prior work in this space has focused on optimizing the robot’s queries within
  each interaction type, there has been little work on optimizing over the selection
  of the interaction type itself. We present INQUIRE, the first algorithm to implement
  and optimize over a generalized representation of information gain across multiple
  interaction types. Our evaluations show that INQUIRE can dynamically optimize its
  interaction type (and respective optimal query) based on its current learning status
  and the robot’s state in the world, resulting in more robust performance across
  tasks in comparison to state-of-the art baseline methods. Additionally, INQUIRE
  allows for customizable cost metrics to bias its selection of interaction types,
  enabling this algorithm to be tailored to a robot’s particular deployment domain
  and formulate cost-aware, informative queries.
