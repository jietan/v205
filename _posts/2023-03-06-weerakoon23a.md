title: 'HTRON: Efficient Outdoor Navigation with Sparse Rewards via  Heavy Tailed
  Adaptive Reinforce Algorithm'
section: Poster
openreview: uPWhEXjyvoo
abstract: 'We present a novel approach to improve the performance of deep reinforcement
  learning (DRL) based outdoor robot navigation systems. Most, existing DRL methods
  are based on carefully designed dense reward functions that learn the efficient
  behavior in an environment. We circumvent this issue by working only with sparse
  rewards (which are easy to design) and propose a novel adaptive Heavy-Tailed Reinforce
  algorithm for Outdoor Navigation called HTRON. Our main idea is to utilize heavy-tailed
  policy parametrizations which implicitly induce exploration in sparse reward settings.
  We evaluate the performance of HTRON against Reinforce, PPO, and TRPO algorithms
  in three different outdoor scenarios: goal-reaching, obstacle avoidance, and uneven
  terrain navigation. We observe average an increase of 34.41% in terms of success
  rate, a 15.15% decrease in the average time steps taken to reach the goal, and a
  24.9% decrease in the elevation cost compared to the navigation policies obtained
  by the other methods. Further, we demonstrate that our algorithm can be transferred
  directly into a Clearpath Husky robot to perform outdoor terrain navigation in real-world
  scenarios.'
