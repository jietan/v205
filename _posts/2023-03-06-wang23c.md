title: On-Robot Learning With Equivariant Models
section: Poster
openreview: K8W6ObPZQyh
abstract: 'Recently, equivariant neural network models have been shown to improve
  sample efficiency for tasks in computer vision and reinforcement learning. This
  paper explores this idea in the context of on-robot policy learning in which a policy
  must be learned entirely on a physical robotic system without reference to a model,
  a simulator, or an offline dataset. We focus on applications of Equivariant SAC
  to robotic manipulation and explore a number of variations of the algorithm. Ultimately,
  we demonstrate the ability to learn several non-trivial manipulation tasks completely
  through on-robot experiences in less than an hour or two of wall clock time. '
