title: Verified Path Following Using Neural Control Lyapunov Functions
section: Poster
openreview: JErNvd_lKHr
abstract: We present a framework that uses control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) to implement
  provably stable path-following controllers for autonomous mobile platforms. Our
  approach is based on learning a guaranteed CLF for path following by using recent
  approaches — combining machine learning with automated theorem proving — to train
  a neural network feedback law along with a CLF that guarantees stabilization for
  driving along low-curvature reference paths. We discuss how key properties of the
  CLF can be exploited to extend the range of  the curvatures for which the stability
  guarantees remain valid. We then demonstrate that our approach yields a controller
  that obeys theoretical guarantees in simulation, but also performs well in practice.
  We show our method is both a verified method of control and better than a common
  MPC implementation in computation time. Additionally, we implement the controller
  on-board on a $\frac18$-scale autonomous vehicle testing platform and present results
  for various robust path following scenarios.
