title: Solving Complex Manipulation Tasks with Model-Assisted Model-Free Reinforcement
  Learning
section: Poster
openreview: 7CrXRhmzVVR
abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning approach for
  improving the sample efficiency of a model-free actor-critic method by using a learned
  model to encourage exploration. The basic idea consists in generating artificial
  transitions with noisy actions, which can be used to update the critic. To counteract
  the model bias, we introduce a high initialization for the critic and two filters
  for the artificial transitions. Finally, we evaluate our approach with the TD3 algorithm
  on different robotic tasks and demonstrate that it achieves a better performance
  with higher sample efficiency than several other model-based and model-free methods.
