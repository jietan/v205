title: 'VIRDO++: Real-World, Visuo-tactile Dynamics and Perception of Deformable Objects'
section: Poster
openreview: GS8xD_elvgC
abstract: 'Deformable objects manipulation can benefit from representations that seamlessly
  integrate vision and touch while handling occlusions. In this work, we present a
  novel approach for, and real-world demonstration of, multimodal visuo-tactile state-estimation
  and dynamics prediction for deformable objects. Our approach, VIRDO++, builds on
  recent progress in multimodal neural implicit representations for deformable object
  state-estimation (VIRDO) via a new formulation for deformation dynamics and a complementary
  state-estimation algorithm that (i) maintains a belief over deformations, and (ii)
  enables practical real-world application by removing the need for privileged contact
  information. In the context of two real-world robotic tasks, we show: (i) high-fidelity
  cross-modal state-estimation and prediction of deformable objects from partial visuo-tactile
  feedback, and (ii) generalization to unseen objects and contact formations. '
