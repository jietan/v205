title: Graph network simulators can learn discontinuous, rigid contact dynamics
section: Poster
openreview: rbIzq-I84i_
abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in techniques for modeling discontinuous dynamics,
  such as rigid contact or switching motion modes, using deep learning. A common claim
  is that deep networks are incapable of accurately modeling rigid-body dynamics without
  explicit modules for handling contacts, due to the continuous nature of how deep
  networks are parameterized. Here we investigate this claim with experiments on established
  real and simulated datasets and show that general-purpose graph network simulators,
  with no contact-specific assumptions, can learn and predict contact discontinuities.
  Furthermore, contact dynamics learned by graph network simulators capture real-world
  cube tossing trajectories more accurately than highly engineered robotics simulators,
  even when provided with only 8 â€“ 16 trajectories. Overall, this suggests that rigid-body
  dynamics do not pose a fundamental challenge for deep networks with the appropriate
  general architecture and parameterization.  Instead, our work opens new directions
  for considering when deep learning-based models might be preferable to traditional
  simulation environments for accurately modeling real-world contact dynamics.
