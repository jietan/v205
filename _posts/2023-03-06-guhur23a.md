title: Instruction-driven history-aware policies for robotic manipulations
section: Oral
openreview: h0Yb0U_-Tki
abstract: 'In human environments, robots are expected to accomplish a variety of manipulation
  tasks given simple natural language instructions. Yet, robotic manipulation is extremely
  challenging as it requires fine-grained motor control, long-term memory as well
  as generalization to previously unseen tasks and environments. To address these
  challenges, we propose a unified transformer-based approach that takes into account
  multiple inputs. In particular, our transformer architecture integrates (i) natural
  language instructions and (ii) multi-view scene observations while (iii) keeping
  track of the full history of observations and actions. Such an approach enables
  learning dependencies between history and instructions and improves manipulation
  precision using multiple views. We evaluate our method on the challenging RLBench
  benchmark and on a real-world robot. Notably, our approach scales to 74 diverse
  RLBench tasks and outperforms the state of the art. We also address instruction-conditioned
  tasks and demonstrate excellent generalization to previously unseen variations. '
