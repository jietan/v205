title: Learning Visuo-Haptic Skewering Strategies for Robot-Assisted Feeding
section: Oral
openreview: lLq09gVoaTE
abstract: 'Acquiring food items with a fork poses an immense challenge to a robot-assisted
  feeding system, due to the wide range of material properties and visual appearances
  present across food groups. Deformable foods necessitate different skewering strategies
  than firm ones, but inferring such characteristics for several previously unseen
  items on a plate remains nontrivial. Our key insight is to leverage visual and haptic
  observations during interaction with an item to rapidly and reactively plan skewering
  motions. We learn a generalizable, multimodal representation for a food item from
  raw sensory inputs which informs the optimal skewering strategy. Given this representation,
  we propose a zero-shot framework to sense visuo-haptic properties of a previously
  unseen item and reactively skewer it, all within a single interaction. Real-robot
  experiments with foods of varying levels of visual and textural diversity demonstrate
  that our multimodal policy outperforms baselines which do not exploit both visual
  and haptic cues or do not reactively plan. Across 6 plates of different food items,
  our proposed framework achieves 71% success over 69 skewering attempts total. Supplementary
