title: 'ROAD: Learning an Implicit Recursive Octree Auto-Decoder to Efficiently Encode
  3D Shapes'
section: Poster
openreview: EVFrjBgYsPZ
abstract: 'Compact and accurate representations of 3D shapes are central to many perception
  and robotics tasks. State-of-the-art learning-based methods can reconstruct single
  objects but scale poorly to large datasets. We present a novel recursive implicit
  representation to efficiently and accurately encode large datasets of complex 3D
  shapes by recursively traversing an implicit octree in latent space. Our implicit
  Recursive Octree Auto-Decoder (ROAD) learns a hierarchically structured latent space
  enabling state-of-the-art reconstruction results at a compression ratio above 99%.
  We also propose an efficient curriculum learning scheme that naturally exploits
  the coarse-to-fine properties of the underlying octree spatial representation. We
  explore the scaling law relating latent space dimension, dataset size, and reconstruction
  accuracy, showing that increasing the latent space dimension is enough to scale
  to large shape datasets. Finally, we show that our learned latent space encodes
  a coarse-to-fine hierarchical structure yielding reusable latents across different
  levels of details, and we provide qualitative evidence of generalization to novel
  shapes outside the training set. '
