title: Learning Generalizable Dexterous Manipulation from Human Grasp Affordance
section: Poster
openreview: h5g_VDJJfbt
abstract: 'Dexterous manipulation with a multi-finger hand is one of the most challenging
  problems in robotics. While recent progress in imitation learning has largely improved
  the sample efficiency compared to Reinforcement Learning, the learned policy can
  hardly generalize to manipulate novel objects, given limited expert demonstrations.
  In this paper, we propose to learn dexterous manipulation using large-scale demonstrations
  with diverse 3D objects in a category, which are generated from a human grasp affordance
  model. This generalizes the policy to novel object instances within the same category.
  To train the policy, we propose a novel imitation learning objective jointly with
  a geometric representation learning objective using our demonstrations. By experimenting
  with relocating diverse objects in simulation, we show that our approach outperforms
  baselines with a large margin when manipulating novel objects. We also ablate the
  importance of 3D object representation learning for manipulation. We include videos
