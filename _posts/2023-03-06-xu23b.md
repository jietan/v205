title: Efficient Tactile Simulation with Differentiability for Robotic Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: 6BIffCl6gsM
abstract: Efficient simulation of tactile sensors can unlock new opportunities for
  learning tactile-based manipulation policies in simulation and then transferring
  the learned policy to real systems, but fast and reliable simulators for dense tactile
  normal and shear force fields are still under-explored. We present a novel approach
  for efficiently simulating both the normal and shear tactile force field covering
  the entire contact surface with an arbitrary tactile sensor spatial layout. Our
  simulator also provides analytical gradients of the tactile forces to accelerate
  policy learning. We conduct extensive simulation experiments to showcase our approach
  and demonstrate successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer for a high-precision peg-insertion
  task with high-resolution vision-based GelSlim tactile sensors.
