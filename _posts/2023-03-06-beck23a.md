title: Hypernetworks in Meta-Reinforcement Learning
section: Poster
openreview: N-HtsQkRotI
abstract: 'Training a reinforcement learning (RL) agent on a real-world robotics task
  remains generally impractical due to sample inefficiency. Multi-task RL and meta-RL
  aim to improve sample efficiency by generalizing over a distribution of related
  tasks. However, doing so is difficult in practice: In multi-task RL, state of the
  art methods often fail to outperform a degenerate solution that simply learns each
  task separately. Hypernetworks are a promising path forward since they replicate
  the separate policies of the degenerate solution while also allowing for generalization
  across tasks, and are applicable to meta-RL. However, evidence from supervised learning
  suggests hypernetwork performance is highly sensitive to the initialization. In
  this paper, we 1) show that hypernetwork initialization is also a critical factor
  in meta-RL, and that naive initializations yield poor performance; 2) propose a
  novel hypernetwork initialization scheme that matches or exceeds the performance
  of a state-of-the-art approach proposed for supervised settings, as well as being
  simpler and more general; and 3) use this method to show that hypernetworks can
  improve performance in meta-RL by evaluating on multiple simulated robotics benchmarks.'
