title: Contrastive Decision Transformers
section: Poster
openreview: uv1nRhayFII
abstract: Decision Transformers (DT) have drawn upon the success of Transformers by
  abstracting Reinforcement Learning as a target-return-conditioned, sequence modeling
  problem. In our work, we claim that the distribution of DTâ€™s target-returns represents
  a series of different tasks that agents must learn to handle. Work in multi-task
  learning has shown that separating the representations of input data belonging to
  different tasks can improve performance. We draw from this approach to construct
  ConDT (Contrastive Decision Transformer). ConDT leverages an enhanced contrastive
  loss to train a return-dependent transformation of the input embeddings, which we
  empirically show clusters these embeddings by their return. We find that ConDT significantly
  outperforms DT in Open-AI Gym domains by 10% and 39% in visually challenging Atari
  domains.
