title: 'GenLoco: Generalized Locomotion Controllers for Quadrupedal Robots'
section: Poster
openreview: mqry_xMzvCM
abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in commercially-available and affordable
  quadrupedal robots, with many of these platforms being actively used in research
  and industry. As the availability of legged robots grows, so does the need for controllers
  that enable these robots to perform useful skills. However, most learning-based
  frameworks for controller development focus on training robot-specific controllers,
  a process that needs to be repeated for every new robot. In this work, we introduce
  a framework for training generalized locomotion (GenLoco) controllers for quadrupedal
  robots. Our framework synthesizes general-purpose locomotion controllers that can
  be deployed on a large variety of quadrupedal robots with similar morphologies.
  We present a simple but effective morphology randomization method that procedurally
  generates a diverse set of simulated robots for training. We show that by training
  a controller on this large set of simulated robots, our models acquire more general
  control strategies that can be directly transferred to novel simulated and real-world
  robots with diverse morphologies, which were not observed during training.
