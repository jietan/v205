title: 'ToolFlowNet: Robotic Manipulation with Tools via Predicting Tool Flow from
  Point Clouds'
section: Poster
openreview: 2gfB_kMVFvP
abstract: Point clouds are a widely available and canonical data modality which convey
  the 3D geometry of a scene. Despite significant progress in classification and segmentation
  from point clouds, policy learning from such a modality remains challenging, and
  most prior works in imitation learning focus on learning policies from images or
  state information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for learning policies
  from point clouds for robotic manipulation with tools. We use a novel neural network,
  ToolFlowNet, which predicts dense per-point flow on the tool that the robot controls,
  and then uses the flow to derive the transformation that the robot should execute.
  We apply this framework to imitation learning of challenging deformable object manipulation
  tasks with continuous movement of tools, including scooping and pouring, and demonstrate
  significantly improved performance over baselines which do not use flow. We perform
  physical scooping experiments with ToolFlowNet and find that we can attain 82% scooping
  success. See https://sites.google.com/view/point-cloud-policy/home for supplementary
