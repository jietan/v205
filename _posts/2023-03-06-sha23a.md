title: Fusing Priori and Posteriori Metrics for Automatic Dataset Annotation of Planar
  Grasping
section: Poster
openreview: y1t0c5eUk2w
abstract: Grasp detection based on deep learning has been a research hot spot in recent
  years.  The performance of grasping detection models relies on high-quality, large-scale
  grasp datasets. Taking comprehensive consideration of quality, extendability, and
  annotation cost, metric-based simulation methodology is the most promising way to
  generate grasp annotation. As experts in grasping, human intuitively tends to make
  grasp decision based both on priori and posteriori knowledge. Inspired by that,
  a combination of priori and posteriori grasp metrics is intuitively helpful to improve
  annotation quality. In this paper, we build a hybrid metric group involving both
  priori and posteriori metrics and propose a grasp evaluator to merge those metrics
  to approximate human grasp decision capability. Centered on the evaluator, we have
  constructed an automatic grasp annotation framework, through which a large-scale,
  high-quality, low annotation cost planar grasp dataset GMD is automatically generated.
