title: Learning Visualization Policies of Augmented Reality for Human-Robot Collaboration
section: Poster
openreview: K0gW0A6gi7G
abstract: In human-robot collaboration domains, augmented reality (AR) technologies
  have enabled people to visualize the state of robots. Current AR-based visualization
  policies are designed manually, which requires a lot of human efforts and domain
  knowledge. When too little information is visualized, human users find the AR interface
  not useful; when too much information is visualized, they find it difficult to process
  the visualized information. In this paper, we develop an intelligent AR agent that
  learns visualization policies (what to visualize, when, and how) from demonstrations.
  We created a Unity-based platform for simulating warehouse environments where human-robot
  teammates work on collaborative delivery tasks. We have collected a dataset that
  includes demonstrations of visualizing robotsâ€™ current and planned behaviors. Our
  results from experiments with real human participants show that, compared with competitive
  baselines from the literature, our learned visualization strategies significantly
  increase the efficiency of human-robot teams in delivery tasks, while reducing the
  distraction level of human users.
