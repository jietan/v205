title: 'Towards Online 3D Bin Packing: Learning Synergies between Packing and Unpacking
  via DRL'
section: Poster
openreview: 1Pt2FM5BLdi
abstract: There is an emerging research interest in addressing the online 3D bin packing
  problem (3D-BPP), which has a wide range of applications in logistics industry.
  However, neither heuristic methods nor those based on deep reinforcement learning
  (DRL) outperform human packers in real logistics scenarios. One important reason
  is that humans can make corrections after performing inappropriate packing actions
  by unpacking incorrectly packed items. Inspired by such an unpacking mechanism,
  we present a DRL-based packing-and-unpacking network (PUN) to learn the synergies
  between the two actions for the online 3D-BPP. Experimental results demonstrate
  that PUN achieves the state-of-the-art performance and the supplementary video shows
  that the system based on PUN can reliably complete the online 3D bin packing task
  in the real world.
