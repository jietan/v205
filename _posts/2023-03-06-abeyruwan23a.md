  Interaction Loops'

abstract: Sim-to-real transfer is a powerful paradigm for robotic reinforcement learning.
  The ability to train policies in simulation enables safe exploration and large-scale
  data collection quickly at low cost. However, prior works in sim-to-real transfer
  of robotic policies typically do not involve any human-robot interaction because
  accurately simulating human behavior is an open problem. In this work, our goal
  is to leverage the power of simulation to train robotic policies that are proficient
  at interacting with humans upon deployment. But there is a chicken and egg problem
  — how to gather examples of a human interacting with a physical robot so as to model
  human behavior in simulation without already having a robot that is able to interact
  with a human? Our proposed method, Iterative-Sim-to-Real (i-S2R), attempts to address
  this. i-S2R bootstraps from a simple model of human behavior and alternates between
  training in simulation and deploying in the real world. In each iteration, both
  the human behavior model and the policy are refined. For all training we apply a
  new evolutionary search algorithm called Blackbox Gradient Sensing (BGS). We evaluate
  our method on a real world robotic table tennis setting, where the objective for
  the robot is to play cooperatively with a human player for as long as possible.
  Table tennis is a high-speed, dynamic task that requires the two players to react
  quickly to each other’s moves, making for a challenging test bed for research on
  human-robot interaction. We present results on an industrial robotic arm that is
  able to cooperatively play table tennis with human players, achieving rallies of
  22 successive hits on average and 150 at best. Further, for 80% of players, rally
  lengths are 70% to 175% longer compared to the sim-to-real plus fine-tuning (S2R+FT)
  baseline. For videos of our system in action please see https://sites.google.com/view/is2r.
