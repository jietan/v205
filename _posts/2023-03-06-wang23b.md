  Sensor Simulation'

abstract: Realistic simulation is key to enabling safe and scalable development of
  self-driving vehicles. A core component is simulating the sensors so that the entire
  autonomy system can be tested in simulation. Sensor simulation involves modeling
  traffic participants, such as vehicles, with high-quality appearance and articulated
  geometry, and rendering them in real-time. The self-driving industry has employed
  artists to build these assets. However, this is expensive, slow, and may not reflect
  reality. Instead, reconstructing assets automatically from sensor data collected
  in the wild would provide a better path to generating a diverse and large set that
  provides good real-world coverage. However, current reconstruction approaches struggle
  on in-the-wild sensor data, due to its sparsity and noise. To tackle these issues,
  we present CADSim which combines part-aware object-class priors via a small set
  of CAD models with differentiable rendering to automatically reconstruct vehicle
  geometry, including articulated wheels, with high-quality appearance. Our experiments
  show our approach recovers more accurate shape from sparse data compared to existing
  approaches. Importantly, it also trains and renders efficiently. We demonstrate
  our reconstructed vehicles in a wide range of applications, including accurate testing
  of autonomy perception systems.
