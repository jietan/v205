title: Safety-Enhanced Autonomous Driving Using Interpretable Sensor Fusion Transformer
section: Poster
openreview: qzMY915hCYX
abstract: Large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles has been continually delayed
  due to safety concerns. On the one hand, comprehensive scene understanding is indispensable,
  a lack of which would result in vulnerability to rare but complex traffic situations,
  such as the sudden emergence of unknown objects. However, reasoning from a global
  context requires access to sensors of multiple types and adequate fusion of multi-modal
  sensor signals, which is difficult to achieve. On the other hand, the lack of interpretability
  in learning models also hampers the safety with unverifiable failure causes. In
  this paper, we propose a safety-enhanced autonomous driving framework, named Interpretable
  Sensor Fusion Transformer (InterFuser), to fully process and fuse information from
  multi-modal multi-view sensors for achieving comprehensive scene understanding and
  adversarial event detection. Besides, intermediate interpretable features are generated
  from our framework, which provide more semantics and are exploited to better constrain
  actions to be within the safe sets. We conducted extensive experiments on CARLA
  benchmarks, where our model outperforms prior methods, ranking the first on the
  public CARLA Leaderboard.
