title: Proactive slip control by learned slip model and trajectory adaptation
section: Poster
openreview: UWTP_JvSug
abstract: 'This paper presents a novel control approach to dealing with a slip during
  robotic manipulative movements. Slip is a major cause of failure in many robotic
  grasping and manipulation tasks. Existing works use increased gripping forces to
  avoid/control slip. However, this may not be feasible, e.g., because (i) the robot
  cannot increase the gripping forceâ€“ the max gripping force has already applied or
  (ii) an increased force yields a damaged grasped object, such as soft fruit. Moreover,
  the robot fixes the gripping force when it forms a stable grasp on the surface of
  an object, and changing the gripping force during manipulative movements in real-time
  may not be feasible, e.g., with the Franka robot. Hence, controlling the slip by
  changing gripping forces is not an effective control policy in many settings. We
  propose a novel control approach to slip avoidance including a learned action-conditioned
  slip predictor and a constrained optimizer avoiding an expected slip given the desired
  robot actions. We show the effectiveness of this receding horizon controller in
  a series of test cases in real robot experimentation. Our experimental results show
  our proposed data-driven predictive controller can control slip for objects unseen
  in training.  '
