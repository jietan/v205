title: 'PRISM: Probabilistic Real-Time Inference in Spatial World Models'
section: Oral
openreview: X_qYPtJLaX8
abstract: 'We introduce PRISM, a method for real-time filtering in a probabilistic
  generative model of agent motion and visual perception. Previous approaches either
  lack uncertainty estimates for the map and agent state, do not run in real-time,
  do not have a dense scene representation or do not model agent dynamics. Our solution
  reconciles all of these aspects. We start from a predefined state-space model which
  combines differentiable rendering and 6-DoF dynamics. Probabilistic inference in
  this model amounts to simultaneous localisation and mapping (SLAM) and is intractable.
  We use a series of approximations to Bayesian inference to arrive at probabilistic
  map and state estimates. We take advantage of well-established methods and closed-form
  updates, preserving accuracy and enabling real-time capability. The proposed solution
  runs at 10Hz real-time and is similarly accurate to state-of-the-art SLAM in small
  to medium-sized indoor environments, with high-speed UAV and handheld camera agents
  (Blackbird, EuRoC and TUM-RGBD). '
