title: A Dual Representation Framework for Robot Learning with Human Guidance
section: Poster
openreview: H6rr_CGzV9y
abstract: The ability to interactively learn skills from human guidance and adjust
  behavior according to human preference is crucial to accelerating robot learning.
  But human guidance is an expensive resource, calling for methods that can learn
  efficiently. In this work, we argue that learning is more efficient if the agent
  is equipped with a high-level, symbolic representation. We propose a dual representation
  framework for robot learning from human guidance. The dual representation used by
  the robotic agent includes one for learning a sensorimotor control policy, and the
  other, in the form of a symbolic scene graph, for encoding the task-relevant information
  that motivates human input. We propose two novel learning algorithms based on this
  framework for learning from human evaluative feedback and from preference. In five
  continuous control tasks in simulation and in the real world, we demonstrate that
  our algorithms lead to significant improvement in task performance and learning
  speed. Additionally, these algorithms require less human effort and are qualitatively
  preferred by users.
