title: 'Training Robots to Evaluate Robots: Example-Based Interactive Reward Functions
  for Policy Learning'
section: Oral
openreview: sK2aWU7X9b8
abstract: Physical interactions can often help reveal information that is not readily
  apparent. For example, we may tug at a table leg to evaluate whether it is built
  well, or turn a water bottle upside down to check that it is watertight. We propose
  to train robots to acquire such interactive behaviors automatically, for the purpose
  of evaluating the result of an attempted robotic skill execution. These evaluations
  in turn serve as "interactive reward functions" (IRFs) for training reinforcement
  learning policies to perform the target skill, such as screwing the table leg tightly.
  In addition, even after task policies are fully trained, IRFs can serve as verification
  mechanisms that improve online task execution. For any given task, our IRFs can
  be conveniently trained using only examples of successful outcomes, and no further
  specification is needed to train the task policy thereafter. In our evaluations
  on door locking and weighted block stacking in simulation, and screw tightening
  on a real robot, IRFs enable large performance improvements, even outperforming
  baselines with access to demonstrations or carefully engineered rewards.
