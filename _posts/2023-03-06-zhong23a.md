title: 'Touching a NeRF: Leveraging Neural Radiance Fields for Tactile Sensory Data
  Generation'
section: Poster
openreview: No3mbanRlZJ
abstract: Tactile perception is key for robotics applications such as manipulation.
  However, tactile data collection is time-consuming, especially when compared to
  vision. This limits the use of the tactile modality in machine learning solutions
  in robotics. In this paper, we propose a generative model to simulate realistic
  tactile sensory data for use in downstream tasks. Starting with easily-obtained
  camera images, we train Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) for objects of interest. We
  then use NeRF-rendered RGB-D images as inputs to a conditional Generative Adversarial
  Network model (cGAN) to generate tactile images from desired orientations. We evaluate
  the generated data quantitatively using the Structural Similarity Index and Mean
  Squared Error metrics, and also using a tactile classification task both in simulation
  and in the real world. Results show that by augmenting a manually collected dataset,
  the generated data is able to increase classification accuracy by around 10%. In
  addition, we demonstrate that our model is able to transfer from one tactile sensor
  to another with a small fine-tuning dataset.
