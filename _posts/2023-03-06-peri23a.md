title: Towards Long-Tailed 3D Detection
section: Poster
openreview: F6iq9FU2xnc
abstract: Contemporary autonomous vehicle (AV) benchmarks have advanced techniques
  for training 3D detectors, particularly on large-scale lidar data. Surprisingly,
  although semantic class labels naturally follow a long-tailed distribution, contemporary
  benchmarks focus on only a few common classes (e.g., pedestrian and car) and neglect
  many rare classes in-the-tail (e.g., debris and stroller). However, AVs must still
  detect rare classes to ensure safe operation. Moreover, semantic classes are often
  organized within a hierarchy, e.g., tail classes such as child and construction-worker
  are arguably subclasses of pedestrian. However, such hierarchical relationships
  are often ignored, which may lead to misleading estimates of performance and missed
  opportunities for algorithmic innovation. We address these challenges by formally
  studying the problem of Long-Tailed 3D Detection (LT3D), which evaluates on all
  classes, including those in-the-tail. We evaluate and innovate upon popular 3D detection
  codebases, such as CenterPoint and PointPillars, adapting them for LT3D. We develop
  hierarchical losses that promote feature sharing across common-vs-rare classes,
  as well as improved detection metrics that award partial credit to "reasonable"
  mistakes respecting the hierarchy (e.g., mistaking a child for an adult). Finally,
  we point out that fine-grained tail class accuracy is particularly improved via
  multimodal fusion of RGB images with LiDAR; simply put, small fine-grained classes
  are challenging to identify from sparse (lidar) geometry alone, suggesting that
  multimodal cues are crucial to long-tailed 3D detection. Our modifications improve
  accuracy by 5% AP on average for all classes, and dramatically improve AP for rare
  classes (e.g., stroller AP improves from 3.6 to 31.6).
