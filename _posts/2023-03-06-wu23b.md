title: Learning Diverse and Physically Feasible Dexterous Grasps with Generative Model
  and Bilevel Optimization
section: Poster
openreview: A12nd105kFr
abstract: To fully utilize the versatility of a multi-fingered dexterous robotic hand
  for executing diverse object grasps, one must consider the rich physical constraints
  introduced by hand-object interaction and object geometry. We propose an integrative
  approach of combining a generative model and a bilevel optimization (BO) to plan
  diverse grasp configurations on novel objects. First, a conditional variational
  autoencoder trained on merely six YCB objects predicts the finger placement directly
  from the object point cloud. The prediction is then used to seed a nonconvex BO
  that solves for a grasp configuration under collision, reachability, wrench closure,
  and friction constraints. Our method achieved an 86.7% success over 120 real world
  grasping trials on 20 household objects, including unseen and challenging geometries.
  Through quantitative empirical evaluations, we confirm that grasp configurations
  produced by our pipeline are indeed guaranteed to satisfy kinematic and dynamic
  constraints. A video summary of our results is available at youtu.be/9DTrImbN99I.
