title: Leveraging Language for Accelerated Learning of Tool Manipulation
section: Poster
openreview: nPw7jaGBrCG
abstract: Robust and generalized tool manipulation requires an understanding of the
  properties and affordances of different tools. We investigate whether linguistic
  information about a tool (e.g., its geometry, common uses) can help control policies
  adapt faster to new tools for a given task. We obtain diverse descriptions of various
  tools in natural language and use pre-trained language models to generate their
  feature representations. We then perform language-conditioned meta-learning to learn
  policies that can efficiently adapt to new tools given their corresponding text
  descriptions. Our results demonstrate that combining linguistic information and
  meta-learning significantly accelerates tool learning in several manipulation tasks
  including pushing, lifting, sweeping, and hammering.
