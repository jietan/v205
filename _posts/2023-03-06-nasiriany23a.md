title: Learning and Retrieval from Prior Data for Skill-based Imitation Learning
section: Poster
openreview: QgXArq7RIh
abstract: Imitation learning offers a promising path for robots to learn general-purpose
  tasks, but traditionally has enjoyed limited scalability due to high data supervision
  requirements and brittle generalization. Inspired by recent work on skill-based
  imitation learning, we investigate whether leveraging prior data from previous related
  tasks can enable learning novel tasks in a more robust, data-efficient manner. To
  make effective use of the prior data, the agent must internalize knowledge from
  the prior data and contextualize this knowledge in novel tasks. To that end we propose
  a skill-based imitation learning framework that extracts temporally-extended sensorimotor
  skills from prior data and subsequently learns a policy for the target task with
  respect to these learned skills. We find a number of modeling choices significantly
  improve performance on novel tasks, namely representation learning objectives to
  enable more predictable and consistent skill representations and a retrieval-based
  data augmentation procedure to increase the scope of supervision for the policy.
  On a number of multi-task manipulation domains, we demonstrate that our method significantly
  outperforms existing imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning approaches.
