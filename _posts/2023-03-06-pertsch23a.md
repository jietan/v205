title: Cross-Domain Transfer via Semantic Skill Imitation
section: Poster
openreview: AdFROt9BoqE
abstract: We propose an approach for semantic imitation, which uses demonstrations
  from a source domain, e.g. human videos, to accelerate reinforcement learning (RL)
  in a different target domain, e.g. a robotic manipulator in a simulated kitchen.
  Instead of imitating low-level actions like joint velocities, our approach imitates
  the sequence of demonstrated semantic skills like "opening the microwave" or "turning
  on the stove". This allows us to transfer demonstrations across environments (e.g.
  real-world to simulated kitchen) and agent embodiments (e.g. bimanual human demonstration
  to robotic arm).  We evaluate on three challenging cross-domain learning problems
  and match the performance of demonstration-accelerated RL approaches that require
  in-domain demonstrations. In a simulated kitchen environment, our approach learns
  long-horizon robot manipulation tasks, using less than 3 minutes of human video
  demonstrations from a real-world kitchen. This enables scaling robot learning via
  the reuse of demonstrations, e.g. collected as human videos, for learning in any
  number of target domains.
