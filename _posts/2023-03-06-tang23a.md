title: Selective Object Rearrangement in Clutter
section: Poster
openreview: 2cEjfernc5P
abstract: 'We propose an image-based, learned method for selective tabletop object
  rearrangement in clutter using a parallel jaw gripper. Our method consists of three
  stages: graph-based object sequencing (which object to move), feature-based action
  selection (whether to push or grasp, and at what position and orientation) and a
  visual correspondence-based placement policy (where to place a grasped object).
  Experiments show that this decomposition works well in challenging settings requiring
  the robot to begin with an initially cluttered scene, selecting only the objects
  that need to be rearranged while discarding others, and dealing with cases where
  the goal location for an object is already occupied â€“ making it the first system
  to address all these concurrently in a purely image-based setting. We also achieve
  an $\sim$ 8% improvement in task success rate over the previously best reported
  result that handles both translation and orientation in less restrictive (un-cluttered,
  non-selective) settings. We demonstrate zero-shot transfer of our system solely
  trained in simulation to a real robot selectively rearranging up to everyday objects,
  many unseen during learning, on a crowded tabletop. Videos:https://sites.google.com/view/selective-rearrangement'
