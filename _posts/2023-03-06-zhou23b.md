title: 'Modularity through Attention: Efficient Training and Transfer of Language-Conditioned
  Policies for Robot Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: uCaNr6_dQB0
abstract: Language-conditioned policies allow robots to interpret and execute human
  instructions. Learning such policies requires a substantial investment with regards
  to time and compute resources. Still, the resulting controllers are highly device-specific
  and cannot easily be transferred to a robot with different morphology, capability,
  appearance or dynamics. In this paper, we propose a sample-efficient approach for
  training language-conditioned manipulation policies that allows for rapid transfer
  across different types of robots. By introducing a novel method, namely Hierarchical
  Modularity, and adopting supervised attention across multiple sub-modules, we bridge
  the divide between modular and end-to-end learning and enable the reuse of functional
  building blocks. In both simulated and real world robot manipulation experiments,
  we demonstrate that our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods
  and can transfer policies across 4 different robots in a sample-efficient manner.
  Finally, we show that the functionality of learned sub-modules is maintained beyond
  the training process and can be used to introspect the robot decision-making process.
