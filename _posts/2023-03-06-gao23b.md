title: Transferring Hierarchical Structures with Dual Meta Imitation Learning
section: Poster
openreview: MUcBYHjzqp7
abstract: Hierarchical Imitation Learning (HIL) is an effective way for robots to
  learn sub-skills from long-horizon unsegmented demonstrations. However, the learned
  hierarchical structure lacks the mechanism to transfer across multi-tasks or to
  new tasks, which makes them have to learn from scratch when facing a new situation.
  Transferring and reorganizing modular sub-skills require fast adaptation ability
  of the whole hierarchical structure. In this work, we propose Dual Meta Imitation
  Learning (DMIL), a hierarchical meta imitation learning method where the high-level
  network and sub-skills are iteratively meta-learned with model-agnostic meta-learning.
  DMIL uses the likelihood of state-action pairs from each sub-skill as the supervision
  for the high-level network adaptation and uses the adapted high-level network to
  determine different data set for each sub-skill adaptation. We theoretically prove
  the convergence of the iterative training process of DMIL and establish the connection
  between DMIL and Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art
  few-shot imitation learning performance on the Meta-world benchmark and competitive
  results on long-horizon tasks in Kitchen environments.
