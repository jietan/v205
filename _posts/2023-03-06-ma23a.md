title: Towards Scale Balanced 6-DoF Grasp Detection in Cluttered Scenes
section: Poster
openreview: tiPHpS4eA4
abstract: In this paper, we focus on the problem of feature learning in the presence
  of scale imbalance for 6-DoF grasp detection and propose a novel approach to especially
  address the difficulty in dealing with small-scale samples. A Multi-scale Cylinder
  Grouping (MsCG) module is presented to enhance local geometry representation by
  combining multi-scale cylinder features and global context. Moreover, a Scale Balanced
  Learning (SBL) loss and an Object Balanced Sampling (OBS) strategy are designed,
  where SBL enlarges the gradients of the samples whose scales are in low frequency
  by apriori weights while OBS captures more points on small-scale objects with the
  help of an auxiliary segmentation network. They alleviate the influence of the uneven
  distribution of grasp scales in training and inference respectively. In addition,
  Noisy-clean Mix (NcM) data augmentation is introduced to facilitate training, aiming
  to bridge the domain gap between synthetic and raw scenes in an efficient way by
  generating more data which mix them into single ones at instance-level. Extensive
  experiments are conducted on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark and competitive results
  are reached with significant gains on small-scale cases. Besides, the performance
  of real-world grasping highlights its generalization ability.
