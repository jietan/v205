title: Offline Reinforcement Learning at Multiple Frequencies
section: Poster
openreview: TGUp8EaCGj9
abstract: 'To leverage many sources of offline robot data, robots must grapple with
  the heterogeneity of such data. In this paper, we focus on one particular aspect
  of this challenge: learning from offline data collected at different control frequencies.
  Across labs, the discretization of controllers, sampling rates of sensors, and demands
  of a task of interest may differ, giving rise to a mixture of frequencies in an
  aggregated dataset. We study how well offline reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms
  can accommodate data with a mixture of frequencies during training. We observe that
  the $Q$-value propagates at different rates for different discretizations, leading
  to a number of learning challenges for off-the-shelf offline RL algorithms. We present
  a simple yet effective solution that enforces consistency in the rate of  $Q$-value
  updates to stabilize learning. By scaling the value of $N$ in $N$-step returns with
  the discretization size, we effectively balance $Q$-value propagation, leading to
  more stable convergence. On three simulated robotic control problems, we empirically
  find that this simple approach significantly outperforms na√Øve mixing both terms
  of absolute performance and training stability, while also improving over using
  only the data from a single control frequency.'
