title: In-Hand Object Rotation via Rapid Motor Adaptation
section: Poster
openreview: Xux9gSS7WE0
abstract: Generalized in-hand manipulation has long been an unsolved challenge of
  robotics. As a small step towards this grand goal, we demonstrate how to design
  and learn a simple adaptive controller to achieve in-hand object rotation using
  only fingertips. The controller is trained entirely in simulation on only cylindrical
  objects, which then – without any fine-tuning – can be directly deployed to a real
  robot hand to rotate dozens of objects with diverse sizes, shapes, and weights over
  the z-axis. This is achieved via rapid online adaptation of the robot’s controller
  to the object properties using only proprioception history. Furthermore, natural
  and stable finger gaits automatically emerge from training the control policy via
  reinforcement learning. Code and more videos are available at https://github.com/HaozhiQi/Hora
