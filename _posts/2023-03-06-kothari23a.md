title: 'Motion Style Transfer: Modular Low-Rank Adaptation for Deep Motion Forecasting'
section: Poster
openreview: tVgD4METs6o
abstract: 'Deep motion forecasting models have achieved great success when trained
  on a massive amount of data. Yet, they often perform poorly when training data is
  limited. To address this challenge, we propose a transfer learning approach for
  efficiently adapting pre-trained forecasting models to new domains, such as unseen
  agent types and scene contexts. Unlike the conventional fine-tuning approach that
  updates the whole encoder, our main idea is to reduce the amount of tunable parameters
  that can precisely account for the target domain-specific motion style. To this
  end, we introduce two components that exploit our prior knowledge of motion style
  shifts: (i) a low-rank motion style adapter that projects and adjusts the style
  features at a low-dimensional bottleneck; and (ii) a modular adapter strategy that
  disentangles the features of scene context and motion history to facilitate a fine-grained
  choice of adaptation layers. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our
  proposed adapter design, coined MoSA, outperforms prior methods on several forecasting
  benchmarks.'
