title: Robustness Certification of Visual Perception Models via Camera Motion Smoothing
section: Poster
openreview: uUxDTZK3o3X
abstract: A vast literature shows that the learning-based visual perception model
  is sensitive to adversarial noises, but few works consider the robustness of robotic
  perception models under widely-existing camera motion perturbations. To this end,
  we study the robustness of the visual perception model under camera motion perturbations
  to investigate the influence of camera motion on robotic perception. Specifically,
  we propose a motion smoothing technique for arbitrary image classification models,
  whose robustness under camera motion perturbations could be certified. The proposed
  robustness certification framework based on camera motion smoothing provides effective
  and scalable robustness guarantees for visual perception modules so that they are
  applicable to wide robotic applications. As far as we are aware, this is the first
  work to provide robustness certification for the deep perception module against
  camera motions, which improves the trustworthiness of robotic perception. A realistic
  indoor robotic dataset with a dense point cloud map for the entire room, MetaRoom,
  is introduced for the challenging certifiable robust perception task. We conduct
  extensive experiments to validate the certification approach via motion smoothing
  against camera motion perturbations. Our framework guarantees the certified accuracy
  of 81.7% against camera translation perturbation along depth direction within -0.1m
  Â  0.1m. We also validate the effectiveness of our method on the real-world robot
  by conducting hardware experiments on the robotic arm with an eye-in-hand camera.
