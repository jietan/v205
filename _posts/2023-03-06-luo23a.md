  Driving'

abstract: We propose \textit{JFP}, a Joint Future Prediction model that can learn
  to generate accurate and consistent multi-agent future trajectories. For this task,
  many different methods have been proposed to capture social interactions in the
  encoding part of the model, however, considerably less focus has been placed on
  representing interactions in the decoder and output stages. As a result, the predicted
  trajectories are not necessarily consistent with each other, and often result in
  unrealistic trajectory overlaps. In contrast, we propose an end-to-end trainable
  model that learns directly the interaction between pairs of agents in a structured,
  graphical model formulation in order to generate consistent future trajectories.
  It sets new state-of-the-art results on Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) for the
  interactive setting. We also investigate a more complex multi-agent setting for
  both WOMD and a larger internal dataset, where our approach improves significantly
  on the trajectory overlap metrics while obtaining on-par or better performance on
  single-agent trajectory metrics.
