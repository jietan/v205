title: 'USHER: Unbiased Sampling for Hindsight Experience Replay'
section: Poster
openreview: 6gEyD5zg0dt
abstract: " Dealing with sparse rewards is a long-standing challenge in reinforcement
  learning (RL). Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) addresses this problem by reusing
  failed trajectories for one goal as successful trajectories for another. This allows
  for both a minimum density of reward and for generalization across multiple goals.
  However, this strategy is known to result in a biased value function, as the update
  rule underestimates the likelihood of bad outcomes in a stochastic environment.
  We propose an asymptotically unbiased importance-sampling-based algorithm to address
  this problem without sacrificing performance on deterministic environments. We show
  its effectiveness on a range of robotic systems, including challenging high dimensional
  stochastic environments."
