title: Where To Start? Transferring Simple Skills to Complex Environments
section: Poster
openreview: WkbvHMQL6uJ
abstract: 'Robot learning provides a number of ways to teach robots simple skills,
  such as grasping. However, these skills are usually trained in open, clutter-free
  environments, and therefore would likely cause undesirable collisions in more complex,
  cluttered environments. In this work, we introduce an affordance model based on
  a graph representation of an environment, which is optimised during deployment to
  find suitable robot configurations to start a skill from, such that the skill can
  be executed without any collisions. We demonstrate that our method can generalise
  a priori acquired skills to previously unseen cluttered and constrained environments,
  in simulation and in the real world, for both a grasping and a placing task. '
