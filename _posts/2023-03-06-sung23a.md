title: 'Learning to Correct Mistakes: Backjumping in Long-Horizon Task and Motion
  Planning'
section: Poster
openreview: rJIwfTxTXvm
abstract: As robots become increasingly capable of manipulation and long-term autonomy,
  long-horizon task and motion planning problems are becoming increasingly important.  A
  key challenge in such problems is that early actions in the plan may make future
  actions infeasible. When reaching a dead-end in the search, most existing planners
  use backtracking, which exhaustively reevaluates motion-level actions, often resulting
  in inefficient planning, especially when the search depth is large. In this paper,
  we propose to learn backjumping heuristics which identify the culprit action directly
  using supervised learning models to guide the task-level search. Based on evaluations
  of two different tasks, we find that our method significantly improves planning
  efficiency compared to backtracking and also generalizes to problems with novel
  numbers of objects.
