title: 'Deep Whole-Body Control: Learning a Unified Policy for Manipulation and Locomotion'
section: Oral
openreview: zldI4UpuG7v
abstract: An attached arm can significantly increase the applicability of legged robots
  to several mobile manipulation tasks that are not possible for the wheeled or tracked
  counterparts. The standard modular control pipeline for such legged manipulators
  is to decouple the controller into that of manipulation and locomotion. However,
  this is ineffective. It requires immense engineering to support coordination between
  the arm and legs, and error can propagate across modules causing non-smooth unnatural
  motions. It is also biological implausible given evidence for strong motor synergies
  across limbs. In this work, we propose to learn a unified policy for whole-body
  control of a legged manipulator using reinforcement learning. We propose Regularized
  Online Adaptation to bridge the Sim2Real gap for high-DoF control, and Advantage
  Mixing exploiting the causal dependency in the action space to overcome local minima
  during training the whole-body system. We also present a simple design for a low-cost
  legged manipulator, and find that our unified policy can demonstrate dynamic and
  agile behaviors across several task setups. Videos are at https://maniploco.github.io
