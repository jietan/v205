title: 'NeuralGrasps: Learning Implicit Representations for Grasps of Multiple Robotic
  Hands'
section: Poster
openreview: OzP68WT3UA
abstract: We introduce a neural implicit representation for grasps of objects from
  multiple robotic hands. Different grasps across multiple robotic hands are encoded
  into a shared latent space. Each latent vector is learned to decode to the 3D shape
  of an object and the 3D shape of a robotic hand in a grasping pose in terms of the
  signed distance functions of the two 3D shapes. In addition, the distance metric
  in the latent space is learned to preserve the similarity between grasps across
  different robotic hands, where the similarity of grasps is defined according to
  contact regions of the robotic hands. This property enables our method to transfer
  grasps between different grippers including a human hand, and grasp transfer has
  the potential to share grasping skills between robots and enable robots to learn
  grasping skills from humans. Furthermore, the encoded signed distance functions
  of objects and grasps in our implicit representation can be used for 6D object pose
  estimation with grasping contact optimization from partial point clouds, which enables
  robotic grasping in the real world.
