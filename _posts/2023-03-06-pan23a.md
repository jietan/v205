title: 'TAX-Pose: Task-Specific Cross-Pose Estimation for Robot Manipulation'
section: Poster
openreview: YmJi0bTfeNX
abstract: How do we imbue robots with the ability to efficiently manipulate unseen
  objects and transfer relevant skills based on demonstrations? End-to-end learning
  methods often fail to generalize to novel objects or unseen configurations. Instead,
  we focus on the task-specific pose relationship between relevant parts of interacting
  objects. We conjecture that this relationship is a generalizable notion of a manipulation
  task that can transfer to new objects in the same category; examples include the
  relationship between the pose of a pan relative to an oven or the pose of a mug
  relative to a mug rack. We call this task-specific pose relationship “cross-pose”
  and provide a mathematical definition of this concept. We propose a vision-based
  system that learns to estimate the cross-pose between two objects for a given manipulation
  task using learned cross-object correspondences. The estimated cross-pose is then
  used to guide a downstream motion planner to manipulate the objects into the desired
  pose relationship (placing a pan into the oven or the mug onto the mug rack). We
  demonstrate our method’s capability to generalize to unseen objects, in some cases
  after training on only 10 demonstrations in the real world. Results show that our
  system achieves state-of-the-art performance in both simulated and real-world experiments
  across a number of tasks. Supplementary information and videos can be found at https://sites.google.com/view/tax-pose/home.
