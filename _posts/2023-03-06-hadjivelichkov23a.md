title: One-Shot Transfer of Affordance Regions? AffCorrs!
section: Poster
openreview: GeM6VUwYinO
abstract: In this work, we tackle one-shot visual search of object parts.  Given a
  single reference image of an object with annotated affordance regions, we segment
  semantically corresponding parts within a target scene.  We propose AffCorrs, an
  unsupervised model that combines the properties of pre-trained DINO-ViTâ€™s image
  descriptors and cyclic correspondences.  We use AffCorrs to find corresponding affordances
  both for intra- and inter-class one-shot part segmentation. This task is more difficult
  than supervised alternatives, but enables future work such as learning affordances
  via imitation and assisted teleoperation.
