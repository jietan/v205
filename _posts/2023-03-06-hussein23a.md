title: Detecting Incorrect Visual Demonstrations for Improved Policy Learning
section: Poster
openreview: tyXMrpEMkDb
abstract: 'Learning tasks only from raw video demonstrations is the current state
  of the art in robotics visual imitation learning research. The implicit assumption
  here is that all video demonstrations show an optimal/sub-optimal way of performing
  the task. What if that is not true? What if one or more videos show a wrong way
  of executing the task? A task policy learned from such incorrect demonstrations
  can be potentially unsafe for robots and humans. It is therefore important to analyze
  the video demonstrations for correctness before handing them over to the policy
  learning algorithm. This is a challenging task, especially due to the very large
  state space. This paper proposes a framework to autonomously detect incorrect video
  demonstrations of sequential tasks consisting of several sub-tasks. We analyze the
  demonstration pool to identify video(s) for which task-features follow a ‘disruptive’
  sequence. We analyze entropy to measure this disruption and – through solving a
  minmax problem – assign poor weights to incorrect videos. We evaluated the framework
  with two real-world video datasets: our custom-designed Tea-Making with a YuMi robot
  and the publicly available 50-Salads. Experimental results show the effectiveness
  of the proposed framework in detecting incorrect video demonstrations even when
  they make up 40% of the demonstration set. We also show that various state-of-the-art
  imitation learning algorithms learn a better policy when incorrect demonstrations
  are discarded from the training pool.'
