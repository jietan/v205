title: 'HERD: Continuous Human-to-Robot Evolution for Learning from Human Demonstration'
section: Poster
openreview: VHia4Cint7
abstract: The ability to learn from human demonstration endows robots with the ability
  to automate various tasks. However, directly learning from human demonstration is
  challenging since the structure of the human hand can be very different from the
  desired robot gripper. In this work, we show that manipulation skills can be transferred
  from a human to a robot through the use of micro-evolutionary reinforcement learning,
  where a five-finger human dexterous hand robot gradually evolves into a commercial
  robot, while repeated interacting in a physics simulator to continuously update
  the policy that is first learned from human demonstration. To deal with the high
  dimensions of robot parameters, we propose an algorithm for multi-dimensional evolution
  path searching that allows joint optimization of both the robot evolution path and
  the policy. Through experiments on human object manipulation datasets, we show that
  our framework can efficiently transfer the expert human agent policy trained from
  human demonstrations in diverse modalities to target commercial robots.
