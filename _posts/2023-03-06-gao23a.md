title: Iterative Interactive Modeling for Knotting Plastic Bags
section: Poster
openreview: KDuBFXyRuE-
abstract: Deformable object manipulation has great research significance for the robotic
  community and numerous applications in daily life. In this work, we study how to
  knot plastic bags that are randomly dropped from the air with a dual-arm robot based
  on image input. The complex initial configuration and terrible material properties
  of plastic bags pose challenges to reliable perception and planning. Directly knotting
  it from random initial states is difficult. To tackle this problem, we propose Iterative
  Interactive Modeling (IIM) to first adjust the plastic bag to a standing pose with
  imitation learning to establish a high-confidence keypoint skeleton model, then
  perform a set of learned motion primitives to knot it. We leverage spatial action
  maps to accomplish the iterative pick-and-place action and a graph convolutional
  network to evaluate the adjusted pose during the IIM process. In experiments, we
  achieve an 85.0% success rate in knotting 4 different plastic bags, including one
  with no demonstration.
