title: Legged Locomotion in Challenging Terrains using Egocentric Vision
section: Oral
openreview: Re3NjSwf0WF
abstract: Animals are capable of precise and agile locomotion using vision. Replicating
  this ability has been a long-standing goal in robotics. The traditional approach
  has been to decompose this problem into elevation mapping and foothold planning
  phases. The elevation mapping, however, is susceptible to failure and large noise
  artifacts, requires specialized hardware, and is biologically implausible. In this
  paper, we present the first end-to-end locomotion system capable of traversing stairs,
  curbs, stepping stones, and gaps. We show this result on a medium-sized quadruped
  robot using a single front-facing depth camera. The small size of the robot necessitates
  discovering specialized gait patterns not seen elsewhere. The egocentric camera
  requires the policy to remember past information to estimate the terrain under its
  hind feet. We train our policy in simulation. Training has two phases - first, we
  train a policy using reinforcement learning with a cheap-to-compute variant of depth
  image and then in phase 2 distill it into the final policy that uses depth using
  supervised learning. The resulting policy transfers to the real world and is able
  to run in real-time on the limited compute of the robot. It can traverse a large
  variety of terrain while being robust to perturbations like pushes, slippery surfaces,
  and rocky terrain. Videos are at https://vision-locomotion.github.io
