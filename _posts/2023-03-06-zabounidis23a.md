title: Concept Learning for Interpretable Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
section: Poster
openreview: TAgVKiF2O8p
abstract: Multi-agent robotic systems are increasingly operating in real-world environments
  in close proximity to humans, yet are largely controlled by policy models with inscrutable
  deep neural network representations. We introduce a method for incorporating interpretable
  concepts from a domain expert into models trained through multi-agent reinforcement
  learning, by requiring the model to first predict such concepts then utilize them
  for decision making. This allows an expert to both reason about the resulting concept
  policy models in terms of these high-level concepts at run-time, as well as intervene
  and correct mispredictions to improve performance. We show that this yields improved
  interpretability and training stability, with benefits to policy performance and
  sample efficiency in a simulated and real-world cooperative-competitive multi-agent
  game.
