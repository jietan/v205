title: 'PI-QT-Opt: Predictive Information Improves Multi-Task Robotic Reinforcement
  Learning at Scale'
section: Poster
openreview: bJS2fBkFZ-K
abstract: The predictive information, the mutual information between the past and
  future, has been shown to be a useful representation learning auxiliary loss for
  training reinforcement learning agents, as the ability to model what will happen
  next is critical to success on many control tasks. While existing studies are largely
  restricted to training specialist agents on single-task settings in simulation,
  in this work, we study modeling the predictive information for robotic agents and
  its importance for general-purpose agents that are trained to master a large repertoire
  of diverse skills from large amounts of data. Specifically, we introduce Predictive
  Information QT-Opt (PI-QT-Opt), a QT-Opt agent augmented with an auxiliary loss
  that learns representations of the predictive information to solve up to 297 vision-based
  robot manipulation tasks in simulation and the real world with a single set of parameters.
  We demonstrate that modeling the predictive information significantly improves success
  rates on the training tasks and leads to better zero-shot transfer to unseen novel
  tasks. Finally, we evaluate PI-QT-Opt on real robots, achieving substantial and
  consistent improvement over QT-Opt in multiple experimental settings of varying
  environments, skills, and multi-task configurations.
