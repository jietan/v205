title: 'BEHAVIOR-1K: A Benchmark for Embodied AI with 1,000 Everyday Activities and
  Realistic Simulation'
section: Oral
openreview: _8DoIe8G3t
abstract: 'We present BEHAVIOR-1K, a comprehensive simulation benchmark for human-centered
  robotics. BEHAVIOR-1K includes two components, guided and motivated by the results
  of an extensive survey on "what do you want robots to do for you?". The first is
  the definition of 1,000 everyday activities, grounded in 50 scenes (houses, gardens,
  restaurants, offices, etc.) with more than 5,000 objects annotated with rich physical
  and semantic properties. The second is OmniGibson, a novel simulation environment
  that supports these activities via realistic physics simulation and rendering of
  rigid bodies, deformable bodies, and liquids. Our experiments indicate that the
  activities in BEHAVIOR-1K are long-horizon and dependent on complex manipulation
  skills, both of which remain a challenge for even state-of-the-art robot learning
  solutions. To calibrate the simulation-to-reality gap of BEHAVIOR-1K, we provide
  an initial study on transferring solutions learned with a mobile manipulator in
  a simulated apartment to its real-world counterpart. We hope that BEHAVIOR-1K’s
  human-grounded nature, diversity, and realism make it valuable for embodied AI and
  robot learning research. Project website: https://behavior.stanford.edu.'
