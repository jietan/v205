title: 'SurroundDepth: Entangling Surrounding Views for Self-Supervised Multi-Camera
  Depth Estimation'
section: Poster
openreview: _u4m5aEbWfU
abstract: 'Depth estimation from images serves as the fundamental step of 3D perception
  for autonomous driving and is an economical alternative to expensive depth sensors
  like LiDAR. The temporal photometric consistency enables self-supervised depth estimation
  without labels, further facilitating its application. However, most existing methods
  predict the depth solely based on each monocular image and ignore the correlations
  among multiple surrounding cameras, which are typically available for modern self-driving
  vehicles. In this paper, we propose a SurroundDepth method to incorporate the information
  from multiple surrounding views to predict depth maps across cameras. Specifically,
  we employ a joint network to process all the surrounding views and propose a cross-view
  transformer to effectively fuse the information from multiple views. We apply cross-view
  self-attention to efficiently enable the global interactions between multi-camera
  feature maps. Different from self-supervised monocular depth estimation, we are
  able to predict real-world scales given multi-camera extrinsic matrices. To achieve
  this goal, we adopt two-frame structure-from-motion to extract scale-aware pseudo
  depths to pretrain the models. Further, instead of predicting the ego-motion of
  each individual camera, we estimate a universal ego-motion of the vehicle and transfer
  it to each view to achieve multi-view consistency. In experiments, our method achieves
  the state-of-the-art performance on the challenging multi-camera depth estimation
  datasets DDAD and nuScenes. '
