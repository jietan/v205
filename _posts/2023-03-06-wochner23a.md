title: 'Learning with Muscles: Benefits for Data-Efficiency and Robustness in Anthropomorphic
  Tasks'
section: Poster
openreview: Xo3eOibXCQ8
abstract: Humans are able to outperform robots in terms of robustness, versatility,
  and learning of new tasks in a wide variety of movements. We hypothesize that highly
  nonlinear muscle dynamics play a large role in providing inherent stability, which
  is favorable to learning. While recent advances have been made in applying modern
  learning techniques to muscle-actuated systems both in simulation as well as in
  robotics, so far, no detailed analysis has been performed to show the benefits of
  muscles in this setting. Our study closes this gap by investigating core robotics
  challenges and comparing the performance of different actuator morphologies in terms
  of data-efficiency, hyperparameter sensitivity, and robustness.
