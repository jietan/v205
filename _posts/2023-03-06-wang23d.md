title: 'QuaDUE-CCM: Interpretable Distributional Reinforcement Learning using Uncertain
  Contraction Metrics for Precise Quadrotor Trajectory Tracking'
section: Poster
openreview: oud6xgdpqVM
abstract: Accuracy and stability are common requirements for Quadrotor trajectory
  tracking systems. Designing an accurate and stable tracking controller remains challenging,
  particularly in unknown and dynamic environments with complex aerodynamic disturbances.
  We propose a Quantile-approximation-based Distributional-reinforced Uncertainty
  Estimator (QuaDUE) to accurately identify the effects of aerodynamic disturbances,
  i.e., the uncertainties between the true and estimated Control Contraction Metrics
  (CCMs). Taking inspiration from contraction theory and integrating the QuaDUE for
  uncertainties, our novel CCM-based trajectory tracking framework tracks any feasible
  reference trajectory precisely whilst guaranteeing exponential convergence. More
  importantly, the convergence and training acceleration of the distributional RL
  are guaranteed and analyzed, respectively, from theoretical perspectives. We also
  demonstrate our system under unknown and diverse aerodynamic forces. Under large
  aerodynamic forces (>2  m/s^2), compared with the classic data-driven approach,
  our QuaDUE-CCM achieves at least a 56.6% improvement in tracking error. Compared
  with QuaDRED-MPC, a distributional RL-based approach, QuaDUE-CCM achieves at least
  a 3 times improvement in contraction rate.
