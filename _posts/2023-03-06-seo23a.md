title: Masked World Models for Visual Control
section: Poster
openreview: Bf6on28H0Jv
abstract: 'Visual model-based reinforcement learning (RL) has the potential to enable
  sample-efficient robot learning from visual observations. Yet the current approaches
  typically train a single model end-to-end for learning both visual representations
  and dynamics, making it difficult to accurately model the interaction between robots
  and small objects. In this work, we introduce a visual model-based RL framework
  that decouples visual representation learning and dynamics learning. Specifically,
  we train an autoencoder with convolutional layers and vision transformers (ViT)
  to reconstruct pixels given masked convolutional features, and learn a latent dynamics
  model that operates on the representations from the autoencoder. Moreover, to encode
  task-relevant information, we introduce an auxiliary reward prediction objective
  for the autoencoder. We continually update both autoencoder and dynamics model using
  online samples collected from environment interaction. We demonstrate that our decoupling
  approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of visual robotic tasks
  from Meta-world and RLBench, e.g., we achieve 81.7% success rate on 50 visual robotic
  manipulation tasks from Meta-world, while the baseline achieves 67.9%. Code is available
