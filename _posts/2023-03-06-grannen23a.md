title: Learning Bimanual Scooping Policies for Food Acquisition
section: Poster
openreview: qDtbMK67PJG
abstract: 'A robotic feeding system must be able to acquire a variety of foods. Prior
  bite acquisition works consider single-arm spoon scooping or fork skewering, which
  do not generalize to foods with complex geometries and deformabilities. For example,
  when acquiring a group of peas, skewering could smoosh the peas while scooping without
  a barrier could result in chasing the peas on the plate. In order to acquire foods
  with such diverse properties, we propose stabilizing food items during scooping
  using a second arm, for example, by pushing peas against the spoon with a flat surface
  to prevent dispersion. The addition of this second stabilizing arm can lead to a
  new set of challenges. Critically, these strategies should stabilize the food scene
  without interfering with the acquisition motion, which is especially difficult for
  easily breakable high-risk food items, such as tofu. These high-risk foods can break
  between the pusher and spoon during scooping, which can lead to food waste falling
  onto the plate or out of the workspace. We propose a general bimanual scooping primitive
  and an adaptive stabilization strategy that enables successful acquisition of a
  diverse set of food geometries and physical properties. Our approach, CARBS: Coordinated
  Acquisition with Reactive Bimanual Scooping, learns to stabilize without impeding
  task progress by identifying high-risk foods and robustly scooping them using closed-loop
  visual feedback. We find that CARBS is able to generalize across food shape, size,
  and deformability and is additionally able to manipulate multiple food items simultaneously.
  CARBS achieves 87.0% success on scooping rigid foods, which is 25.8% more successful
  than a single-arm baseline, and reduces food breakage by 16.2% compared to an analytical
  baseline. Videos can be found on our website at https://sites.google.com/view/bimanualscoop-corl22/home.'
