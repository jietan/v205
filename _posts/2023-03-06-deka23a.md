title: ARC - Actor Residual Critic for Adversarial Imitation Learning
section: Poster
openreview: V3Mjpi4kzdn
abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) is a class  of popular state-of-the-art
  Imitation Learning algorithms commonly used in robotics. In AIL, an artificial adversaryâ€™s
  misclassification is used as a reward signal that is optimized by any standard Reinforcement
  Learning (RL) algorithm. Unlike most RL settings, the reward in AIL is $differentiable$
  but current model-free RL algorithms do not make use of this property to train a
  policy. The reward is AIL is also $shaped$ since it comes from an adversary. We
  leverage the differentiability property of the shaped AIL reward function and formulate
  a class of Actor Residual Critic (ARC) RL algorithms. ARC algorithms draw a parallel
  to the standard Actor-Critic (AC) algorithms in RL literature and uses a residual
  critic, $C$ function (instead of the standard $Q$ function) to approximate only
  the discounted future return (excluding the immediate reward). ARC algorithms have
  similar convergence properties as the standard AC algorithms with the additional
  advantage that the gradient through the immediate reward is exact. For the discrete
  (tabular) case with finite states, actions, and known dynamics, we prove that policy
  iteration with $C$ function converges to an optimal policy. In the continuous case
  with function approximation and unknown dynamics, we experimentally show that ARC
  aided AIL outperforms standard AIL in simulated continuous-control and real robotic
  manipulation tasks. ARC algorithms are simple to implement and can be incorporated
  into any existing AIL implementation with an AC algorithm.
