title: Robust Trajectory Prediction against Adversarial Attacks
section: Oral
openreview: uhhA2OryTjj
abstract: Trajectory prediction using deep neural networks (DNNs) is an essential
  component of autonomous driving (AD) systems.  However, these methods are vulnerable
  to adversarial attacks, leading to serious consequences such as collisions. In this
  work, we identify two key ingredients to defend trajectory prediction models against
  adversarial attacks including (1) designing effective adversarial training methods
  and (2) adding domain-specific data augmentation to mitigate the performance degradation
  on clean data. We demonstrate that our method is able to improve the performance
  by 46% on adversarial data and at the cost of only 3% performance degradation on
  clean data, compared to the model trained with clean data. Additionally, compared
  to existing robust methods, our method can improve performance by 21% on adversarial
  examples and 9% on clean data. Our robust model is evaluated with a planner to study
  its downstream impacts. We demonstrate that our model can significantly reduce the
  severe accident rates (e.g., collisions and off-road driving).
