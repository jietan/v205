abstract: Goal-conditioned policies for robotic navigation can be trained on large,
  unannotated datasets, providing for good generalization to real-world settings.
  However, particularly in vision-based settings where specifying goals requires an
  image, this makes for an unnatural interface. Language provides a more convenient
  modality for communication with robots, but contemporary methods typically require
  expensive supervision, in the form of trajectories annotated with language descriptions.
  We present a system, LM-Nav, for robotic navigation that enjoys the benefits of
  training on unannotated large datasets of trajectories, while still providing a
  high-level interface to the user. Instead of utilizing a labeled instruction following
  dataset, we show that such a system can be constructed entirely out of pre-trained
  models for navigation (ViNG), image-language association (CLIP), and language modeling
  (GPT-3), without requiring any fine-tuning or language-annotated robot data. LM-Nav
  extracts landmarks names from an instruction, grounds them in the world via the
  image-language model, and then reaches them via the (vision-only) navigation model.
  We instantiate LM-Nav on a real-world  mobile robot and demonstrate long-horizon
  navigation through complex, outdoor environments from natural language instructions.
