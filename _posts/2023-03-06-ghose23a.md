title: 'Tailoring Visual Object Representations to Human Requirements: A Case Study
  with a Recycling Robot'
section: Poster
openreview: "-8Kt5J-9AI"
abstract: Robots are well-suited to alleviate the burden of repetitive and tedious
  manipulation tasks. In many applications though, a robot may be asked to interact
  with a wide variety of objects, making it hard or even impossible to pre-program
  visual object classifiers suitable for the task of interest. In this work, we study
  the problem of learning a classifier for visual objects based on a few examples
  provided by humans. We frame this problem from the perspective of learning a suitable
  visual object representation that allows us to distinguish the desired object category
  from others. Our proposed approach integrates human supervision into the representation
  learning process by combining contrastive learning with an additional loss function
  that brings the representations of human examples close to each other in the latent
  space. Our experiments show that our proposed method performs better than self-supervised
  and fully supervised learning methods in offline evaluations and can also be used
  in real-time by a robot in a simplified recycling domain, where recycling streams
  contain a variety of objects.
