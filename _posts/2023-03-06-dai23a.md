title: Socially-Attentive Policy Optimization in Multi-Agent Self-Driving System
section: Poster
openreview: KXkzplx6H2K
abstract: 'As increasing numbers of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are being deployed,
  it is important to construct a multi-agent self-driving (MASD) system for navigating
  traffic flows of AVs. In an MASD system, AVs not only navigate themselves to pursue
  their own goals, but also interact with each other to prevent congestion or collision,
  especially in scenarios like intersection or lane merging. Multi-agent reinforcement
  learning (MARL) provides an appealing alternative to generate safe and efficient
  actions for multiple AVs. However, current MARL methods are limited to describe
  scenarios where agents interact in either a cooperative of competitive fashion within
  one episode. Ordinarily, the agentsâ€™ objectives are defined with a global or team
  reward function, which fail to deal with the dynamic social preferences (SPs) and
  mixed motives like human drivers in traffic interactions. To this end, we propose
  a novel MARL method called Socially-Attentive Policy Optimization (SAPO), which
  incorporates: (a) a self-attention module to select the most interactive traffic
  participant for each AV, and (b) a social-aware integration mechanism to integrate
  objectives of interacting AVs by estimating the dynamic social preferences from
  their observations. SAPO solves the problem of how to improve the safety and efficiency
  of MASD systems, by enabling AVs to learn socially-compatible behaviors. Simulation
  experiments show that SAPO can successfully capture and utilize the variation of
  the SPs of AVs to achieve superior performance, compared with baselines in MASD
  scenarios.'
