title: Learning the Dynamics of Compliant Tool-Environment Interaction for Visuo-Tactile
  Contact Servoing
section: Poster
openreview: 5GJ-_KMLASa
abstract: Many manipulation tasks require the robot to control the contact between
  a grasped compliant tool and the environment, e.g. scraping a frying pan with a
  spatula. However, modeling tool-environment interaction is difficult, especially
  when the tool is compliant, and the robot cannot be expected to have the full geometry
  and physical properties (e.g., mass, stiffness, and friction) of all the tools it
  must use. We propose a framework that learns to predict the effects of a robotâ€™s
  actions on the contact between the tool and the environment given visuo-tactile
  perception. Key to our framework is a novel contact feature representation that
  consists of a binary contact value, the line of contact, and an end-effector wrench.
  We propose a method to learn the dynamics of these contact features from real world
  data that does not require predicting the geometry of the compliant tool. We then
  propose a controller that uses this dynamics model for visuo-tactile contact servoing
  and show that it is effective at performing scraping tasks with a spatula, even
  in scenarios where precise contact needs to be made to avoid obstacles.
