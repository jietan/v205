title: Learning Agile Skills via Adversarial Imitation of Rough Partial Demonstrations
section: Oral
openreview: x6INXlnUGro
abstract: Learning agile skills is one of the main challenges in robotics. To this
  end, reinforcement learning approaches have achieved impressive results. These methods
  require explicit task information in terms of a reward function or an expert that
  can be queried in simulation to provide a target control output, which limits their
  applicability. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial method for inferring
  reward functions from partial and potentially physically incompatible demonstrations
  for successful skill acquirement where reference or expert demonstrations are not
  easily accessible. Moreover, we show that by using a Wasserstein GAN formulation
  and transitions from demonstrations with rough and partial information as input,
  we are able to extract policies that are robust and capable of imitating demonstrated
  behaviors. Finally, the obtained skills such as a backflip are tested on an agile
  quadruped robot called Solo 8 and present faithful replication of hand-held human
  demonstrations.
