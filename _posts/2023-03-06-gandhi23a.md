title: Eliciting Compatible Demonstrations for Multi-Human Imitation Learning
section: Poster
openreview: iRabxvK3j0
abstract: Imitation learning from human-provided demonstrations is a strong approach
  for learning policies for robot manipulation. While the ideal dataset for imitation
  learning is homogenous and low-variance - reflecting a single, optimal method for
  performing a task - natural human behavior has a great deal of heterogeneity, with
  several optimal ways to demonstrate a task. This multimodality is inconsequential
  to human users, with task variations manifesting as subconscious choices; for example,
  reaching down, then across to grasp an object, versus reaching across, then down.
  Yet, this mismatch presents a problem for interactive imitation learning, where
  sequences of users improve on a policy by iteratively collecting new, possibly conflicting
  demonstrations. To combat this problem of demonstrator incompatibility, this work
  designs an approach for 1) measuring the compatibility of a new demonstration given
  a base policy, and 2) actively eliciting more compatible demonstrations from new
  users. Across two simulation tasks requiring long-horizon, dexterous manipulation
  and a real-world “food plating” task with a Franka Emika Panda arm, we show that
  we can both identify incompatible demonstrations via post-hoc filtering, and apply
  our compatibility measure to actively elicit compatible demonstrations from new
  users, leading to improved task success rates across simulated and real environments.
