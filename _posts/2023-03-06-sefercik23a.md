title: Learning Markerless Robot-Depth Camera Calibration and End-Effector Pose Estimation
section: Poster
openreview: eI8CZ2s267o
abstract: Traditional approaches to extrinsic calibration use fiducial markers and
  learning-based approaches rely heavily on simulation data. In this work, we present
  a learning-based markerless extrinsic calibration system that uses a depth camera
  and does not rely on simulation data. We learn models for end-effector (EE) segmentation,
  single-frame rotation prediction and keypoint detection, from automatically generated
  real-world data. We use a transformation trick to get EE pose estimates from rotation
  predictions and a matching algorithm to get EE pose estimates from keypoint predictions.
  We further utilize the iterative closest point algorithm, multiple-frames, filtering
  and outlier detection to increase calibration robustness. Our evaluations with training
  data from multiple camera poses and test data from previously unseen poses give
  sub-centimeter and sub-deciradian average calibration and pose estimation errors.
  We also show that a carefully selected single training pose gives comparable results.
